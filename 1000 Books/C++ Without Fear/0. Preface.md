# Preface

- It’s safe to say that C++ is the most important programming language in the world today.
- C++, the successor to the original C language, remains true to the goal of producing efficient programs while maximizing programmer productivity. It typically produces executable files second in compactness only to machine code, but it enables you to get far more done. More often than not, C++ is the language of choice for professionals.
## We’ll Have Fun, Fun, Fun...

- Anything worth learning is worth a certain amount of effort. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be fun, which brings us to this book.
## C++: How to “Think Objects”

- Object orientation is a way of building a program around intelligent data types. A major goal of this edition is to showcase object orientation as a superior, more modular way to program, and how to “think objects.”
## Anything Not Covered?

- Nothing good in life is free.
- C++ is perhaps the largest programming language on earth.
- It’s a mistake for an introductory text to try to cover absolutely everything in a language of this size. But once you want to learn more about advanced topics in C++, there are plenty of resources.

- The book I’d recommend is
	1. Bjarne Stroustrup’s ***The C++ Programming Language***, Fourth Edition (Addison-Wesley, 2013). This is a huge, sophisticated, and exhaustive text, and I recommend it after you’ve learned to be comfortable writing C++ code.
