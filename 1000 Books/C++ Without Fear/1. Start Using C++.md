# 1. Start Using C++

- ***compiling*** - the process of translating C++ statements into machine code.
- After compiling, the program also has to be linked to standard functions stored in the C++ library. This process is called ***linking***. After this step is successfully completed, you have an executable program.

- Before using a variable, you must declare it.
- To get keyboard input into a variable, you can use the `cin` object.
