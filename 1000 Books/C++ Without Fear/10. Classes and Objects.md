# 10. Classes and Objects

- A class declaration has this form:
```cpp
class class_name {
	declarations
};
```

- In C++, the `struct` keyword is equivalent to the `class` keyword, except that in classes declared with `struct`, members are `public` by default.
- Because members of a class declared with the `class` keyword are `private` by default, you need to declare at least one member `public`.

- function definitions inside a class do not end with a semicolon.

- Functions of a class can refer to other members within that same class without use of the scope operator (`::`).
- To place a member-function definition outside its classâ€™s declaration, use this syntax:
```cpp
type class_name::function_name (argument_list)
	statements
}
```

- If you place a member-function definition inside the class declaration, the function is `inline`. When the function is called, machine instructions that implement the function are placed into the body of the program.
- When you inline a function, no semicolon is needed after the closing brace.
