# 17. New Features of C++14

- The `decltype` keyword returns the type of its argument.
- Use the `nullptr` keyword to initialize a pointer that “points nowhere.”
```cpp
int *p = nullptr;
```

- The R prefix is used in C++11-complaint compilers to permit raw-string literals in which no character needs to be escaped, not even quote marks (`"`) and back-slashes (`\`). The sequences "`(` and `)`" delimit the string. 

- Here is the general syntax:
```cpp
R"(raw-string-text)"
```
