# 5. Function - Many Are Called

- You need to declare all your functions at the beginning of the program so that C++ has the type information required.
- Function declarations, also called ***prototypes***, use this syntax:
```cpp
type function_name (argument_list);
```

- You also need to define the function somewhere in the program, to tell what the function does.
- Function definitions use this syntax:
```cpp
type function_name (argument_list) {
statements
}
```

- ***Global variables*** are declared outside all function definitions, preferably before main.
- Global variables enable functions to share common data, but such sharing provides the possibility of one function interfering with another. It’s a good policy not to make a variable global unless there’s a clear need to do so.
