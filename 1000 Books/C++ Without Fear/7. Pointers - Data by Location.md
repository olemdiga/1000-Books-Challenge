# 7. Pointers - Data by Location

- A ***pointer*** is a variable that can contain a numeric memory address. You can declare a pointer by using the following syntax:
```cpp
type *p;
```

- You can initialize a pointer by using the address operator (`&`).
```cpp
p = &n;       // Assign address of n to p.
```

- Once a pointer is initialized, you can use the indirection operator (`*`) to manipulate data pointed to by the pointer.
```cpp
p = &n;
*p = 5;       // Assign 5 to n.
```
