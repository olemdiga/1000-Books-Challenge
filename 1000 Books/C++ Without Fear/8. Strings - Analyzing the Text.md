# 8. Strings - Analyzing the Text

- The stream operator (`>>`), used with the `cin` object, provides only limited control over input. When you use it to send data to a string address, it only gets the characters up to the first white space (blank, tab, or newline).
- To get a full line of input, use the `cin.getline()` member function.
```cpp
cin.getline(input_string, max);
```

- To get a line of input with a string object, use the `getline` function, which is a global function, not a member.
```cpp
getline(cin, str_obj);
```
