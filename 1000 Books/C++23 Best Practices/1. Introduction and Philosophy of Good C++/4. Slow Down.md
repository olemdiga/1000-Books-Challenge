# 4. Slow Down

- Dozens of solutions exist in C++ for any given problem. Dozens of more opinions exist for which of these solutions are the best. Copying and pasting from one application to another is easy. Forging ahead with the solutions you are comfortable with is easy.
- How many times have you said, “wow, this is going to take a complicated class hierarchy to implement this solution?”
	- If the solution seems large or complex, stop.
	- Now is a good time to go for a walk and ponder the solution.
	- When you’re done with your walk, discuss the design friend or rubber duck.

- The key point is to not forge ahead blindly with the solutions with which you are comfortable. Be willing to stop for a minute. The older I get, the less time I spend programming, and the more time I spend thinking. In the end, I implement the solution as fast or faster than I used to and with less complexity.
