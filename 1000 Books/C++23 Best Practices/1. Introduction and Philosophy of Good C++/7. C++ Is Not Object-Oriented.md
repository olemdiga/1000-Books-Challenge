# 7. Remember: C++ Is Not Object-Oriented

- I’m not the first person to state this, and I won’t be the last. I think this concept is now well accepted, but I still see learners of C++ focusing on “OOP.”

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that
	- is a better C,
	- supports data abstraction,
	- supports object-oriented programming, and
	- supports generic programming.

- You must understand that C++ is a multi-discipline programming language to make the most of the language. C++ supports effectively all of the programming paradigms that exist today.
	- Procedural
	- Functional
	- Object-Oriented
	- Generic
	- Compile-Time (constexpr and template metaprogramming) 

- Knowing when it is appropriate to use each of these tools is the key to writing good C++. Projects that rigidly stick to one paradigm miss out on the best features of the language.
	- ***Dont try to use every technique possible all of the time. You will end up with a mess of difficult to maintain and read code. Appropriately using the appropriate techniques at the appropriate time takes discipline and practice.***
