# 8. Learn Another Language

- Considering that C++ is not an object-oriented language, you have to know many different techniques to make the most of C++. 
- So it helps to be exposed to other languages. But the fact is that currently, few languages are pure single paradigm languages.
- Every language has its preferred way of doing things that work within the languageâ€™s preferred paradigm.
- Languages that look like C-family languages will likely be more comfortable for you. Try to find a language that looks different and stretches your mind.
