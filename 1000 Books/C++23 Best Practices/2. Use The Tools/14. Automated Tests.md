# 14. Automated Tests

- You need a single command to run tests. If you don’t have that, no one will run the tests.
	- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) - popular and well supported testing framework from Phil Nash and Martin Hořeňovský
	- [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) - similar to catch2, but trimmed for compile-time performance
	- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
	- [Boost.Test](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html) - testing framework, boost style. 

- [ctest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) is a test runner for CMake that can be used with any of the above frameworks. It is utilized via the [add_test](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_test.html) feature of CMake. 

- You need to be familiar with these tools, what they do, and pick from them.
- Without automated tests the rest of this book is pointless. You cannot apply the practical exercises if you cannot verify that you did not break the existing code.
- Oleg Rabaev on CppCast stated:
	- If a component is hard to test, it is not properly designed.
	- If a component is easy to test, it is a good indication that it is properly designed.
	- If a component is properly designed, it is easy to test.
