# 15. Continuous Builds

- Without automated tests, it is impossible to maintain project quality.
- In the C++ projects I have worked on throughout my career, I’ve had to support some combination of: 
	- x86
	- x64 
	- SPARC 
	- ARM 
	- MIPSEL
- On 
	- Windows 
	- Solaris
	- MacOS
	- Linux 
- When you start to combine multiple compilers across multiple platforms and architectures, it becomes increasingly likely that a significant change on one platform will break one or more other platforms.
- To solve this problem, enable continuous builds with continuous tests for your projects.
	- Test all possible combinations of platforms that you support 
	- Test Debug and Release separately 
	- Test all configuration options 
	- Test against newer compilers than you support or require

- If you don’t require 100% tests passing, you will never know the code’s state.
- Understand your organization’s current continuous build environment. If one does not exist, what are the barriers to getting it set up? How hard would it be to get something like GitLab, GitHub actions, Appveyor, or Travis set up for your projects?
