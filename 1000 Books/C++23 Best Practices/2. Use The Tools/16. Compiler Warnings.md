# 16. Compiler Warnings

- There are many warnings you are not using, most of them beneficial. 
- `-Wall` is not all warnings on GCC and Clang. 
- `-Wextra` is still barely scratching the surface!

- ***`/Wall` on MSVC is all of the warnings. Our compiler writers do not recommend using /Wall on MSVC or Weverything on Clang, because many of these are diagnostic warnings that are not actionable. GCC does not provide an equivalent***

- Strongly consider `-Wpedantic` (GCC/Clang). This command line options disable language extensions and get you closer to the C++ standard.
- The more warnings you enable today, the easier time you will have porting to another platform in the future.
