# 17. Static Analysis

- Static analysis tools are tools that analyze your code without compiling or executing it. Your compiler is one such tool and your first line of defense.
- Many such tools are free and some are free for open source projects.
- ***cppcheck*** and ***clang-tidy*** are two popular and free tools with major IDE and editor integration.
