# 18. Consider Custom Static Analysis

- Remember to focus on making your interface hard to use wrong. Then, as a second line of defense, consider writing your own static analysis.

- These might take the form of:
	- [custom clang-tidy analysis](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/Contributing.html)
	- using clang-query to query the [AST](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersReference.html) of your project for common errors 
	- writing a [custom rule](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/files/Articles/) for cppcheck 
	- [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) custom check
