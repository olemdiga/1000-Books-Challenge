# 19. Sanitizers

- The sanitizers are runtime analysis tools for C++ and are built into GCC, Clang, and MSVC.
- If you are familiar with Valgrind, the sanitizers provide similar functionality but many orders of magnitude faster than Valgrind. 

- Available sanitizers are:
	- Address (ASan)
	- Undefined Behavior (UBSan)
	- Thread
	- DataFlow (use for code analysis, not finding bugs) 
	- Lib Fuzzer 

- Address sanitizer, UB Sanitizer, Thread sanitizer can find many issues almost like magic. Support is currently increasing in MSVC at the time of this bookâ€™s writing, while GCC and Clang have more established support for the sanitizers.
- When an error such as an out of bounds memory access occurs, the sanitizer will give you a report of what conditions led to the failure, often with suggestions for fixing the problem. 
- Sanitizers must also be enabled during the linking phase of the project build.
- ***Remember to combine Debug, Release, Sanitizers-on, and Sanitizers-off builds, as each combination can expose different code issues.***
