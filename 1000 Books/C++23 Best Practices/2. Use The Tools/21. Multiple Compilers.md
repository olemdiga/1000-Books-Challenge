# 21. Multiple Compilers

- Support ***at least*** 2 compilers on your platform. Each compiler does different analyses and implements the standard in a slightly different way. 
- If you use Linux, you should be able to switch between GCC and Clang easily.

- A new version of the compiler you currently require is always a good idea. But if you only support GCC, consider adding Clang. Or if you only support Clang, add GCC. If you’re on Windows, add MinGW or Clang in addition to MSVC.
## Add Another Operating System

- Hopefully, at least some portion of your project can be ported to another operating system. The exercise of getting parts of the project compiling on another operating system and toolchain will teach you a lot about your code’s nature.
