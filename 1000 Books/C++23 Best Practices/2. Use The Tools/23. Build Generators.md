# 23. Build Generators

- CMake
- Meson
- Bazel
- Others

- Raw make files or Visual Studio project files make each of the things listed above too tricky to implement. Use a build tool to help you with maintaining portability across platforms and compilers.

- Treat your build scripts like any other code. They have their own set of best practices, and itâ€™s just as easy to write unmaintainable build scripts as it is to write unmaintainable C++.
- Build generators also help abstract and simplify your continuous build environment with tools like `cmake --build`, which does the correct thing regardless of the platform in use.
