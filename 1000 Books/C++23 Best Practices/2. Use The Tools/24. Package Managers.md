# 24. Package Managers

- Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in package managers for C++. These two have become the most popular:
	- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
	- [Conan](https://conan.io/)

- There is a definite advantage to using a package manager. Package managers help with portability and reducing maintenance load on developers.
- I also want to draw your attention to [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)
- CPM provides a simple and straightforward direct integration into CMake for building and linking to “fetch_content-able” CMake projects.
## What are your dependencies?
 - Take time to inventory your project’s dependencies. Compare your dependencies with what is available with the package managers above. Does any one package manager have all of your dependencies? How out of date are your current packages? What security fixes are you currently missing?
