# 25. Make your interfaces hard to use wrong.

- Your interface is your first line of defense. If you provide an interface that is easy to use wrong, your users will use it wrong. 
- If you provide an interface thatâ€™s hard to use wrong, your users have to work harder to use it wrong. But this is still C++; they will always find a way. 
- Interfaces hard to use wrong will sometimes result in more verbose code where we would maybe like more terse code. You have to choose what is most important. Correct code or short code?
