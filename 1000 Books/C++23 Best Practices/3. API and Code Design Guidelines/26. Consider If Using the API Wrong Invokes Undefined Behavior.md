# 26. Consider If Using the API Wrong Invokes Undefined Behavior

- Do you accept a raw pointer? Is it an optional parameter? What happens if nullptr is passed to your function?
- What happens if a value out of the expected range is passed to your function? 
- Some developers make the distinction between “internal” and “external” APIs. They allow unsafe APIs for internal use only.
- ***Is there any guarantee that an external user will never invoke the “internal” API?***
- ***Is there any guarantee that your internal users will never misuse the API?***

- The C++ Guideline Support Library (GSL) has a not_null pointer type that guarantees, because of zero cost abstractions, that the pointer passed is never nullptr. Would that work for your APIs that currently pass raw pointers (assuming that rearchitecting the API is not an option)?

- `std::string_view` (C++17) and `std::span` (C++20) are great alternatives to pointer / length pairs passed to functions.
