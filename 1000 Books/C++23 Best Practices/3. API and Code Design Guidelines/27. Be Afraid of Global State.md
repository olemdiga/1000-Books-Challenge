# 27. Be Afraid of Global State

- Reasoning about global state is hard.
- Any non-const static value, or `std::shared_ptr<>` could potentially be global state. It is never known who might update the value or if it is thread-safe to do so.
- Global state can result in subtle and difficult to trace bugs where one function changes global state, and another function either relies on that change or is adversely affected by it.

- If you’ve done the other exercises, you’ve already made all of your `static` variables `const`. This is great! You’ve possibly even made some of them `constexpr`, which is even better!
- But you probably have global state still lurking. Do you have a global singleton logger? Could the logger be accidentally sharing state between the modules of your system? 
- What about other singletons? Can they be eliminated? Do they have threading initialization issues (what happens if two threads try to access one of the objects for the first time at the same time)?
