# 28. Use Stronger Types

- In many cases, it only takes a little effort to make more strongly typed APIs.
## Avoid Boolean Arguments 

- “Make code intelligible at the point of call. Avoid Boolean arguments”
- In C++11, enum class gives you an easy way to add stronger typing, avoid boolean parameters, and make your API harder to use wrong. 

- ***What function call do you regularly get out of order? How can it be fixed?***
## Consider =deleteing problematic

- Simple function declaration. 
```cpp
double high_precision_thing(double);
```
- What if calling the above with a float is likely to be a bug? 

- Deleting a problematic accidental promotion from `float` to `double`. 
```cpp
double high_precision_thing(double);
```
 
```cpp
doublehigh_precision_thing(float)=delete;
```

- Any function or overload can be `=deleted` in C++11.
