# 30. Forget Header Files Exist

- C++23 has full support for C++ modules, and the standard library is now mandated to provide modules.

- Evidence from Microsoft, who, at the time of the writing of this section, has the most complete modules implementation, shows that this is actually considerably faster than including header files.
- No code has to be immediately parsed when a module is included, so there’s effectively no cost, which is why it’s OK that the entire standard library is now included under a single import directive.

- C++23 modules should be used (remember to forget header files exist), but they do introduce a new challenge to making sure your library can be correctly used.
