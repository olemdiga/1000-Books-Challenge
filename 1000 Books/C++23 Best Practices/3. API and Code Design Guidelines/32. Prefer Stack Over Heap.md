# 32. Prefer Stack Over Heap

- Stack objects (locally scoped objects that are not dynamically allocated) are much more optimizer friendly, cache-friendly, and may be entirely eliminated by the optimizer. As Björn Fahller has said, “assume any pointer indirection is a cache miss.”

- Generally speaking, objects created with new expressions (or via make_unique o make_shared) are heap objects, and have Dynamic Storage Duration. Objects created in a local scope are stack objects and have Automatic Storage Duration. 
- It’s much easier for the compiler and tools to find reads of uninitialized stack values than heap values.
- Sometimes developers with C and Java backgrounds have a hard time with this. For Java, it’s because new is required to create objects. For C, it is because the C compiler cannot perform the same kinds of optimizations that the C++ compiler can because of differences in the language. So some of this unnecessary heap usage may have ended up in your current code.

- There are several heap profiling tools, and there may even be one built into your IDE. Examine your heap usage and look for potential abuses of the heap in your project. It’s possible that most of your heap allocations come from accidental copies of containers such as `std::string` or `std::vector`.
