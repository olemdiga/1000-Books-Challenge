# 34. Know Your Containers

- Prefer your containers in this order:
	- `std::array<>`
	- `std::vector<>`

- `std::array<>`
	- A fixed-size stack-based contiguous container. The data size must be known at compile-time, and you must have enough stack space to hold the data. This container helps us prefer stack over heap. Known location and contiguousness results in `std::array<>` becoming a “negative cost abstraction.” The compiler can perform an extra set of optimizations because it knows the data’s size and location.
- `std::vector<>`
	- A dynamically-sized heap-based contiguous container. While the compiler does not know where the data will ultimately reside, it does know that the elements are laid out adjacent to each other in RAM. Contiguousness gives the compiler more optimization opportunities and is more cache-friendly. 
- Almost anything else needs a comment and justification for why. A flat map with linear search is likely better than an `std::map` for small containers. But don’t be too enthusiastic about this. If you need key lookup, use `std::map` and evaluate if it has the performance and characteristics you want. 
## Replace vector With array

- Look for fixed-size vectors and replace them with array where possible. With C++17’s Class Template Argument Deduction, this can be easier.
