# 35. Be Aware of Custom Allocation And PMR 

- C++17 added Polymorphic Memory Resources (PMR) which makes it trivially easy to add your own custom allocation strategies to the standard containers.
- (Unfortunately, only GCC and MSVC implement this C++17 feature at the time of publication of this book.)

- I do not recommend using PMR or other custom allocation strategies everywhere in the code. They should be mostly unnecessary if you follow the rest of the rules in this book.
- However, I do consider it to be a best practice to know that these strategies exist and they can be used as tools to limit your use of the heap and get the “last mile” performance you might need. 

- The C++ standard provides several different allocation strategies that can be layered with fallbacks, and it’s easy to create your own.
## Where Does PMR Fit In Your Project? 

- Run a heap profiler and look for extraneous heap allocations. Eliminate those that you can.
- Experiment with PMR in the remaining hotspots to see where it might be able to help.
## Understand “Winking Out” Of Data 

- This is an advanced topic and not for the faint of heart 
- It is possible to actually create the contained object itself inside of the pmr resource
- When you do this it’s possible to safely avoid calling all destructors if all data is owned by the one buffer resource 
- Spend some time [appreciating the concept](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_weekly/blob/master/PMR/performance_tests.cpp#L259-L274)
