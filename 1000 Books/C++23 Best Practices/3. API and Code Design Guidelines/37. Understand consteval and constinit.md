# 37. Understand consteval and constinit

- I’ve already encouraged you to use constexpr.
- C++20 added consteval and constinit, and it’s important to understand what they do: 
- Variable Declaration:
	- `consteval int x = /**/` - not valid, `consteval` applies only to functions 
	- `constexpr int x = /**/ `- declares a `const` value that is usable at compile time, and may be evaluated at compile time, if required
	- `static constexpr int x = /**/` - declares a `const` value that is usable at compile time, and is evaluated at compile time
	- `constinit int x = /**/` - not valid
	- `static constinit int x = /**/` - declares a non-const value (ie, mutable) that is not usable at compile time, but is evaluated at compile time 
- Function Declaration:
	- `consteval int func(int)` - declares a function that must be evaluated at compile-time
	- `constexpr int func(int)` - declares a function that may be called at compile-time
	- `constinit int func(int)` - not valid, constinit applies only to variables
## Discuss if there is ever a time when a user-defined-literal should not be consteval?
- User Defined Literals provide a shortcut for converting a literal into another type. 
- The standard library provides many different user defined literals. Two notable, but distinct ones are for `std::string` and `std::string_view`.
