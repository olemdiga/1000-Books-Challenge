# 38. Prefer Spaceships

- C++20 can generate any comparison operator for you (colloquially knows as the “spaceship operator” because of its shape).
	- If you define `==`, the compiler will automatically generate `!=`
	- If you define `<=>`, the compiler will generate all other comparisons (except for `==` and `!=`)
	- You can explicitly default any comparison operation

- The C++ standard has started deprecating explicit comparison operations, look to it for examples.
- Note that `std::string`, for the sake of performance, has a custom implemented `operator==` (provides`==` and `!=`) and `operator<=>` (provides the rest).

- If you provide a custom `operator<=>` you must provide your own `operator==`
- It is unlikely that an explicitly defaulted `operator==` will do the correct thing if you need a custom `operator<=>`
