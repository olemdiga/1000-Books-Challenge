# 39. Follow the Rule of 0 

- No destructor is always better when itâ€™s the correct thing to do. Empty destructors can destroy performance:
	- They make the type no longer trivial
	- Have no functional use
	- Can affect inlining of destruction
	- Implicitly disable move operations

- ***If you need a destructor because you are doing resource management or defining a base case with virtual functions, you need to follow the Rule of 5.***
- `std::unique_ptr` can help you apply the Rule of 0 if you provide a custom deleter.
