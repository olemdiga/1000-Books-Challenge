# 40. If You Must Do Manual Resource Management, Follow the Rule of 5

- If you provide a destructor because `std::unique_ptr` doesnâ€™t make sense for your use case, you must `=delete`, `=default`, or implement the other special member functions.
- This rule was initially known as the Rule of 3 and is known as the Rule of 5 after C++11.
- ***`=delete` is a safe way of dealing with the special member functions if you don't know what to do with them!***
