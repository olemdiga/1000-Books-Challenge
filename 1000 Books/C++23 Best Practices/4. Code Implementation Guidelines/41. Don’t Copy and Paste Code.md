# 41. Don’t Copy and Paste Code

- If you find yourself going to select a block of code and copy it: stop!
	- Take a step back and look at the code again.
	- Why are you copying it?
	- How similar will the source be to the destination?
	- Does it make sense to make a function?
	- Remember, Don’t Be Afraid of Templates

- I have found that this simple rule has had the most direct influence on my code quality.
- If the result of the paste operation was going in the current function, consider using a lambda.
- C++14 style lambdas, with generic (aka `auto`) parameters, give you a simple and easy to use method of creating reusable code that can be shared with different data types while not having to deal with template syntax.
## Try CPD

- There are a few different copy-paste-detectors that look for duplicated code in your codebase. 
- For this exercise, download the [PMD CPD](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html) tool and run it on your codebase. 
- If you use Arch Linux, this tool can be installed with AUR. The package is pmd; the tool is pmd cpd. 

- Can you identify critical parts of your code that have been copied and pasted? What happens if you find a bug in one version? Will you be sure to see all of the locations that also need to be updated?
