# 42. Prefer format Over iostream Or c-formatting Functions

- C++20 added the `<format>` header, which provides the function `std::format`.
- `std::format` takes a format string, parameters, and returns an `std::string` object.
- format is
	- faster to compile than iostreams
	- faster to execute than iostreams
	- more readable than iostreams
	- more type safe than printf family of functions
