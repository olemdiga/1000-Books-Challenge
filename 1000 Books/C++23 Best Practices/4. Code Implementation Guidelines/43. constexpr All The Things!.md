# 43. constexpr All The Things!

- ***I’m using a much stronger argument for `constexpr` than I ever have before!***
- C++23 and modules together eliminate almost every remaining reason to not be using `constexpr`.
- `constexpr` functions declared in your module interface file should now be your default. 
	- With modules it is truly “pay for what you use” (almost 0 cost to the consumer of the module) 
	- `constexpr` enables use cases you have not considered for compile-time computation
	- A powerful technique is to compute as much as possible at compile-time, then continue computation at runtime from a known point
	- These techniques are only possible if our core libraries are `constexpr` enabled. 

- Gone are the days of `#define`. `constexpr` should be your new default! Unfortunately, people over-complicate `constexpr`, so let’s break down the simplest thing.
- ***You need C++26 to get `constexpr` trig functions from your standard library.***
