# 44. Make globals in headers inline constexpr

1. Be afraid of global state!
2. Forget header files exist.

- ***All global data shoud be `constexpr`***
- But global `constexpr` values are perfectly safe. They cannot mutate and they cannot affect “spooky action at a distance.” 
- If you still have header files because you haven’t completely moved over to modules yet...
	- ***All global `constexpr` values should be inline `constexpr`***
	- ***Inside of module interfaces, `constexpr` globals and inline `constexpr` globals both have "external linkage" so we don't have to worry about that.***
