# 45. const Everything That’s Not constexpr

- Many people have said this many times. Making objects const does two things:
	1. It forces us to think about the initialization and lifetime of objects, which affects performance.
	2. Communicates meaning to the readers of our code.

- And as an aside, if it’s a `static` object, the compiler is now free to move it into the constants portion of the binary, which can affect the optimizer.
## Look for `const` opportunities

- As you read through your code, you should look for variables that are not `const` and make them `const`.
	- If a variable is not const, ask why not?
	- Would using a lambda or adding a named function allow you to make the value `const`?

- Did you make any `static` variables `const` in the process? Then go to the `constexpr` exercise.
	- ***`const` for values that are going to be returned can break implicit moves in some cases***
- However, it’s important to note that relying on implicit moves for return values and RVO can be a little fragile in general. Best is to simply not ever give a name to the object you are returning.
- ***You probably don't want to make `class` members `const`; it can break essential things such as move construction and move assignment, and sometimes silently.***
