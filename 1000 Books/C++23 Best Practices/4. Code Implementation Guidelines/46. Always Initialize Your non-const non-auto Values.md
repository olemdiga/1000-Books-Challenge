# 46. Always Initialize Your non-const non-auto Values

- The ideal is to `const` everything, which forces you to initialize. However, that’s not always possible. 
- Similarly, if you use auto, you are forced to initialize an object. 
- The compiler will “throw away” operations on uninitialized values.
- Make sure you have your `-Wunitialized` style warnings enabled.
