# 47. Prefer auto in Many Cases

- I’m not an Almost Always Auto (AAA) person, but let me ask you this: What is the result type of `std::count?`
- My answer is, “I don’t care.” 

- Using `auto` avoids unnecessary conversions and data loss. Same as ranged-for loops. `auto` requires initialization, the same as `const`, the same reasoning for why that's good.
