# 50. Prefer Algorithms Over Loops

- Algorithms communicate meaning and help us apply the “const All The Things” rule. In C++20, we get ranges, which make algorithms more comfortable to use.
- It’s possible, taking a functional approach and using algorithms, that we can write C++ that reads like a sentence. 
## Study existing loops 

- Next time you are reading through a loop in your codebase, cross-reference it with the C++ `<algorithm>` header and try to find an algorithm that applies instead.
