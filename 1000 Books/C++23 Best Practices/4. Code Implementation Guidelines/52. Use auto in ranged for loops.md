# 52. Use auto in ranged for loops

- Not using `auto` can make it easier to have silent mistakes in your code.
- Prefer:
	- `const auto &` for non-mutating loops 
	- `auto &` for mutating loops 
	- `auto &&` only when you have to work with weird types like `std::vector<bool>`, or if moving elements out of the container
