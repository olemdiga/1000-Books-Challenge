# 54. Prefer Scoped enum

- C++11 introduced scoped enumerations, intended to solve many of the common problems with enum inherited from C.
- The `enum class` versions cannot get mixed up without much effort, and their identifiers are now scoped, not global.
- `enum struct` and `enum class` are equivalent. Logically `enum struct` makes more sense since they are `public` names. Which do you prefer?
- Decide if you prefer `enum struct` or `enum class` and develop a well-reasoned answer as to why.
