# 55. Prefer `if constexpr` over SFINAE

- SFINAE is kind-of write-only code. `if constexpr` doesn’t have the same flexibility, but use it when you can.

- The combination of `if constexpr`, `concepts`, and `requires` results in a very powerful, almost reflection-like capability. 
# 56. De-template-ize Your Generic Code

- Move things outside of your templates when you can. Use other functions. Use base classes. The compiler is still free to inline them or leave them out of line. 
- De-template-ization will improve compile times and reduce binary sizes. Both are helpful. It also eliminates the thing that people think of as “template code bloat” (which IMO doesn’t exist)
## Bloaty McBloatface and -ftime-trace

- We’re getting more and more tools available to look for bloat in our binaries and analyze compile times. Look into these tools and other tools available on your platform. 
- Run them against your binary and see what you find. 
- When using clang’s `-ftime-trace`, also look into ClangBuildAnalyzer.
