# 57. Use Lippincott Functions

- Same arguments as de-template-izing your code: This is a do-not-repeat-yourself principle for exception handling routines. 
- A Lippincott function (named after Lisa Lippincott) provides a centralized exception handling routine. 
## Do You Use Exceptions?
- If your project uses exceptions, thereâ€™s probably some ground for simplifying and centralizing your error handling routines. If it does not use exceptions, then you likely have other types of error handling routines that are duplicated. Can these be simplified?
