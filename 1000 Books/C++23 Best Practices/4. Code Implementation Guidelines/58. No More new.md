- Youâ€™re already avoiding the heap and using smart pointers for resource management, right?!
- Take this to the next level and be sure to use `std::make_unique<>()` (C++14) in the rare cases that you need the heap. 
- In the very rare cases you need shared ownership, use `std::make_shared<>()` (C++11).
