# 59. Avoid `std::bind` and `std::function`

- While compilers continue to improve and the optimizers work around these types’ complexity, it’s still very possible for either to add considerable compile-time and runtime overhead.
- C++14 lambdas, with generalized capture expressions, are capable of the same things that `std::bind` is capable of.
- `std::function` is not `constexpr` enabled, which is another reason it might need to be avoided in your code.
