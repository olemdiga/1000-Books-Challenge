# 61. Consider Designated Initializers (C++20)

- Direct-Initialization provides a highly efficient way of initializing public data members. 
- C++20 added “designated initializers” that allow you to specify the name of the object you are initializing. 
	- They must be initialized in order 
	- Items may be skipped
	- Names must be consistently provided 

- In many cases simple public structs are better than complex classes with getters, setters, and constructors. But this is only true if there are no interdependencies between the values. (invariants)
