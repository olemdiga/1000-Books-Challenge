# 62. Improving Build Time 

- A few practical considerations for making build time less painful
	- De-template-ize your code where possible
	- Use forward declarations where it makes sense to 
	- Enable PCH (precompiled headers) in your build system
	- Use ccache or similar (many other options that change regularly, Google for them)
	- Be aware of unity builds
	- Know the possibilities and limitations of extern template
	- Use a build analysis tool to see where build time is spent 
## Use an IDE

- This is the most surprising side effect of using a modern IDE that I have observed: IDEâ€™s do realtime analysis of the code. Realtime analysis means that you know as you are typing if the code is going to compile. Therefore, you spend less time waiting for builds.
