# 65. Understand The Lambda 

- A surprising complexity hides behind the simple lambda of C++. Initially added in C++11, it was initially constrained. With each version of C++, the lambda becomes more flexible and powerful.
- Lambdas reverse some of the defaults from the rest of C++. Default `const` and automatically `constexpr` when possible; they give us some of what we wish the rest of the language could have.

- If you understand every aspect of C++â€™s lambdas and how the compiler implements them, you know everything important about C++.
