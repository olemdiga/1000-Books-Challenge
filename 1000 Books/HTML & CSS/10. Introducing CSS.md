# 10. Introducing CSS

- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
## Understanding CSS: Thinking Inside The Box

- The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
### Block & Inline Elements

- There is a difference between block level and inline elements and how how browsers display them.
- Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include the `<h1>` -`<h6>` , `<p>` and `<div>` elements.
- Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<b>`, `<i>` , `<img>` , `<em>` and `<span>`.

- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
- Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text inside a box - for example, its color, size, and the typeface used.
## CSS Associates Style Rules with HTML Elements

- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.
- These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
- A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

```css
p { 
	font-family: Arial;}
```

- This rule indicates that all `<p>` elements should be shown in the Arial typeface.
- ***Selectors*** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
- ***Declarations*** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.
## CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed

- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a ***property*** and a ***value***, separated by a ***colon***. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
	font-family: Arial;
	color: yellow;}
```

- This rule indicates that all `<h1>`, `<h2>` and `<h3>` elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color.
- ***Properties*** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
- ***Values*** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.
## Using External CSS

`<link>`
- The `<link>` element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element, and it lives inside the `<head>` element.
- It should use three attributes:

`href`
- This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
`type`
- This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
`rel`
- This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.

```css
<head>
		 <title>Using External CSS</title>
		 <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"
			 rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

- An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a `<link>` element for every CSS file it uses. For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.
## Using Internal CSS

`<style>`
- You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a `<style>` element, which usually sits inside the `<head>` element of the page.
- The `<style>` element should use the `type` attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be `text/css`.
- When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet. This:
	- Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).
	- Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.
	- Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).
## CSS Selectors

- There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.
- The table below introduces the most commonly used CSS selectors.
- Before that, there is an HTML file to demonstrate which elements these CSS selectors would apply to.
- CSS selectors are case sensitive, so they must match element names and attribute values exactly. 
- There are some more advanced selectors which allow you to select elements based on attributes and their values.

## How CSS Rules Cascade

- If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.
### LAST RULE

- If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence.
### SPECIFICITY

- If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
### IMPORTANT

- You can add `!important` after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.

- Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties on individual elements that need to appear differently.
## Inheritance

- If you specify the font-family or color properties on the `<body>` element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is ***inherited*** by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).

- You can compare this with the background-color or border properties; they are not inherited by child elements. If these were inherited by all child elements then the page could look quite messy.

- You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from their parent elements by using `inherit` for the value of the properties.
## Why use External Style Sheets?

- When building a website there are several advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet.

- All of your web pages can share the same style sheet. This is achieved by using the `<link>` element on each HTML page of your site to link to the same CSS document. This means that the same code does not need to be repeated in every page (which results in less code and smaller HTML pages).
- Therefore, once the user has downloaded the CSS stylesheet, the rest of the site will load faster. If you want to make a change to how your site appears, you only need to edit the one CSS file and all of your pages will be updated. For example, you can change the style of every `<h1>` element by altering the one CSS style sheet, rather than changing the CSS rules on every page. The HTML code will be easier to read and edit because it does not have lots of CSS rules in the same document. It is generally considered good practice to have the content of the site separated from the rules that determine how it appears.

- Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as your HTML code.

- If you are just creating a single page, you might decide to put the rules in the same file to keep everything in one place.
- If you have one page which requires a few extra rules (that are not used by the rest of the site), you might consider using CSS in the same page.
## Different versions of CSS & Browser Quirks

- CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.

- Any seasoned user of CSS will tell you that some browsers display a few of the CSS properties in an unexpected way. But finding and squashing those bugs is easy when you know how...

- Before launching any new site, it is important to test it in more than one browser, because there can be slight differences in how browsers display the pages.
- You do not need lots of computers to test your site, as there are online tools to show you what a page looks like in multiple browsers:
	- BrowserCam.com
	- BrowserLab.Adobe.com
	- BrowserShots.org
	- CrossBrowserTesting.com

- Using these tools, it is a good idea to check the site on different operating systems (PC, Mac, and Linux) and in older versions of the major browsers, as well as recent versions.
- When you look at your site in more than one browser, you might find that some elements on your page do not look as you expect them to. 

- When a CSS property does not display as expected, it is generally referred to as a browser quirk or CSS bug. Some common browser bugs are discussed in this book, but there are many smaller bugs that only occur in rare situations, or on old browsers that few people use.

- If you come across a CSS bug, you can use your favorite search engine to try and find a solution.
