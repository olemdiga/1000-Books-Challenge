# 4. Links

- Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag.
- The value of the `href` attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

---
- Example:

```html
<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`
```

- Result:

<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>

---

- The text between the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag is known as ***link text.*** Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it.
- Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer.
- To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to.
## Linking to Other Sites

- When you link to a different website, the value of the `href` attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an ***absolute*** URL.
- Browsers show links in blue with an underline by default.
### Absolute URLs

- ***URL*** stands for ***Uniform Resource Locator***. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.
- An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.
## Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site

- When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a ***relative*** URL.
- If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the `href` attribute is just the name of the file.
- If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.

---
- Example:

```html
<p>
<ul>
		 <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
		 <li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>
		 <li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
		 <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
```

- Result:

<p>
	<ul>
		 <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
		 <li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>
		 <li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
		 <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>

## Directory  Structure

- On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
### Structure

- The top-level folder is known as the ***root*** folder.
- The root folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website.
- Each section of the site is placed in a separate folder; this helps organize the files.
### Relationships

- The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
### Homepages

- The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called ***index.html***.

![](img1.png)

- Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the ***path*** to that page or image.
- The path to the homepage of this site is www.examplearts.com/index.html.
- The path to the logo for the site is examplearts.com/images/logo.gif.

- Each sub-directory contains:
	- A file called index.html which is the homepage for that section.
## Relative URLs

- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
- When you are linking to a page on your own website, you do not need to specify the domain name. You can use relative URLs which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page.
- Because you do not need to repeat the domain name in each link, they are also quicker to write.

- If all of the files in your site are in one folder, you simply use the file name for that page.

- If your site is organized into separate folders (or directories),you need to tell the browser how to get from the page it is currently on to the page that you are linking to.

- If you link to the same page from two different pages you might, therefore, need to write two different relative URLs.

| Relative Link Type                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Same Folder***<br>To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file name.                                                                                                       | To link to music reviews from the music homepage:<br>`<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>`    |
| ***Child Folder***<br>For a child folder, use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the file name.                                                             | To link to music listings from the homepage:<br>`<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>` |
| ***Grandchild Folder***<br>Use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the name of the grandchild folder, followed by another forward slash, then the file name. | To link to DVD reviews from the homepage:<br>`<a href="movies/dvd/reviews.html">Reviews</a>` |
| ***Parent Folder***<br>Use ../ to indicate the folder above the current one, then follow it with the file name.                                                                          | To link to the homepage from the music reviews:<br>`<a href="../index.html">Home</a>`        |
| ***GrandParent Folder***<br>Repeat the ../ to indicate that you want to go up two folders (rather than one), then follow it with the file name.                                          | To link to the homepage from the DVD reviews:<br>`<a href="../../index.html">Home</a>`       |
## Email Links

`mailto:`
- To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the `<a>` element.
- However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with `mailto:` and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
- An email link looks just like any other link but, when it is clicked on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person specified in the link.

---
- Example:
```html
<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>
```

- Result
<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>

## Opening Links in a New Window

`target`
- If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the `target` attribute on the opening `<a>` tag. The value of this attribute should be `_blank`.
- One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to another website. In such cases, they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the other one.
- Generally you should avoid opening links in a new window, but if you do, it is considered good practice to inform users that the link will open a new window before they click on it.

---
- Example:
```html
<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)
```

- Result:

<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)

## Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page

- At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.
- Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the `id` attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). 
- The value of the `id` attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two `id` attributes should have the same value.
- To link to an element that uses an `id` attribute you use the `<a>` element again, but the value of the `href` attribute starts with the `#` symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.

---
- Example:

```html
<h1 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h1>
<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br>
<a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br>
<a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br><br>

<h2 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h2>
<p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an
encircling or moving camera</p>

<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
<p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not
specifically tied to the plot, that appears
within a film</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene
preceding the the main action or plot of a film;
contrast to epilogue</p>

<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
```

- Result

<h1 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h1>
<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br>
<a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br>
<a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br><br>
<h2 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h2>
<p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an
encircling or moving camera</p>

<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
<p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not
specifically tied to the plot, that appears
within a film</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene
preceding the the main action or plot of a film;
contrast to epilogue</p>

<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

## Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page

-  If you want to link to a specific part of a different page you can use a similar technique.
- As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.
- Therefore, the `href` attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the `#` symbol, followed by the value of the `id` attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
