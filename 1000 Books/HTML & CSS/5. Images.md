# 5. Images

## Choosing Images for Your Site

- A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
- Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.

- Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from another website.

- If you have a page that shows several images (such as product photographs or members of a team) then putting them on a simple, consistent background helps them look better as a group.

- ***Images Should...***
	- Be relevant
	- Convey information
	- Convey the right mood
	- Be instantly recognizable
	- Fit the color palette
## Storing Images on Your Site

- If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.
- As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. All of the images are stored in a folder called images.

- On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the ***images*** folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called ***interface***, product photographs might sit in a page called products, and images related to news might live in a folder called ***news***.
## Adding Images

`<img>`
- To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there isno closing tag). ***It must carry the following two attributes:***
`src`
- This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.
`alt`
- This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
`title`
- You can also use the titleattribute with the `<img>` element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

---
- Example:
```html
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
marsupial that is similar in size to the
domestic cat." />
```

- Result:

<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
marsupial that is similar in size to the
domestic cat." />

---

- The text used in the `alt` attribute is often referred to as ***alt text***. It should give an accurate description of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software (used by people with visual impairments) and search engines.
- If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (and it has no meaning, such as a graphic dividing line), then the alt attribute should still be used but the quotes should be left empty.
## Height & Width of Images

- An `<img>` element use two other attributes that specify its size:
`height`
- This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
`width`
- This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
---
- Example:
```html
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" />
```

----

- Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.
- The size of images is increasingly being specified using CSS rather than HTML.
## Where to place Images in Your Code

- Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways:
	- **Block elements always appear on a new line**. If the `<img>` is followed by a block level element (such as a paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line after the image.
	- **Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line.** If the `<img>` element is inside a block level element, any text or other inline elements will flow around the image.
## Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally

`align`
- The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.

- The align attribute can take these horizontal values:
`left`
- This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
`right`
- This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).
## Old Code: Aligning Images Vertically

- There are three values that the align attribute can take that control how the image should align vertically with the text that surrounds it:
`top`
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.
`middle`
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
`bottom`
- This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.
## Three Rules for Creating Images

1. ***Save Images in the Right Format*** - Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
2. ***Save Images at the Right Size*** - You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified, the image will take longer to display on the page.
3. ***Use the Correct Resolution*** - Computer screens are made up of dots known as ***pixels***. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. ***Resolution*** refers to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.
## Tools To Edit & Save Images

- There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution.
- The most popular tool amongst web professionals is ***Adobe Photoshop***.
- The full version of Photoshop is expensive.
## Image Formats: JPEG

- Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
- A photograph that features snow or an overcast sky might look like it has large areas that are just white or gray, but the picture is usually made up of many different colors that are subtly different.

- Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.
- When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as ***flat color.*** Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors. 
## Image Dimensions

- The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
-  It is important to understand how you can alter the dimensions of an image.

1. ***Reducing Image Size*** 
	- You can reduce the size of images to create a smaller version of the image.
	- This will create an image that is quicker to download.
2. ***Increasing Image Size***
	- You can't increase the size of photos significantly without affecting the image quality.
	- The image will look blurry or blocky.
3. ***Changing Shape***
	- Only some images can be cropped without losing valuable information.
	- Only some images can be cropped and still make sense.
## Cropping Images

- When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.
## Image Resolution

- Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
- JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as ***bitmap***. They are made up of lots of miniature squares.

- Images in print materials (such as books and magazines) are made up of tiny circles called ***dots***. These images are usually printed at a resolution of ***300*** dots per inch (dpi).

- Due to the fact that computer displays are capped at a resolution of 72 ppi, using images on the web with a higher resolution will not result in better image quality - only in larger file sizes, which will increase the time needed to load them and therefore slow down viewing of your web pages.
## Vector Images

- Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as ***Adobe Illustrator***.
- ***Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)*** are a relatively new format used to display vector images directly on the web (eliminating the need to create bitmap versions of them), however its use is not yet widespread.
## Animated GIFs

- Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

- Because GIFs are not an ideal format for displaying photographs, animated GIFs are really only suitable for simple illustrations.
## Transparency

- Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats:
1. ***Transparent GIF***
	- If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected).
2. ***PNG***
	- If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG.
## HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption

`<figure>`
- Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new` <figure>` element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
- You can have more than one image inside the `<figure>` element as long as they all share the same caption.
`<figcaption>`
- The `<figcaption>` element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
- Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an <img> element with its caption.
---
- Example:
```html
<figure>
<img src="images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in water">
<br>
<figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- Result

<figure>
<img src="images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of two sea otters floating in water">
<br>
<figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
