# Prologue

- Max was going to work too, but his job wouldn’t have him home after nine hours for a good night’s sleep. He’d be cloistered for days this time. Once he put his plan into motion, there’d be no going home. No slipping out for a bite of dinner. No date night at the multiplex. ***Nothing until he was done.***

- Shrugging off his discomfort, Max sat at his keyboard and trained a bead on the Web forums where computer criminals gathered – virtual cantinas with names like DarkMarket and TalkCash. For two days, he hacked, his fingers flying at preternatural speed as he breached the sites’ defenses, stealing their content, log-ins, passwords, and e-mail addresses. When he tired, he crashed out on the apartment’s foldaway bed for an hour or two, then returned bleary-eyed to his work. 

- He finished with a few keystrokes that wiped out the sites’ databases with the ease of an arsonist flicking a match.
