- Hacking from home was for idiots and teenagers - Max had learned that lesson the hard way. Thanks to Wi-Fi, he could now work from almost anywhere with complete anonymity. This time, if the police traced back one of Max’s hack attacks, they’d wind up on the doorstep of whatever poor sap Max had used for connectivity.

- Hacking any one particular target can be difficult; depending on the target, maybe even impossible. But scan hundreds or thousands of systems, and you’re guaranteed to find some that are soft. It was a numbers game.
