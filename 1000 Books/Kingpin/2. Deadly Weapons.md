# 2. Deadly Weapons

- Like most everything else on the pre-Web Internet, a MUD was a purely textual experience – a universe defined entirely by prose and navigated by simple commands like “north” and “south.”

- A common joke had it that MUD really stood for ***“multi-undergraduate destroyer.”*** For Max, that would prove more than just a joke.

- In the stories, Cymoril is the beloved of Elric, a weak albino transformed into a fearsome wizard emperor by dint of a magic sword called Stormbringer. To Max, the fictional sword was a metaphor for ***the power of a computer – properly wielded, it might turn an ordinary man into a king.*** But for Elric, Stormbringer was also a curse: ***He was bound to the sword, fought to tame it, and was ultimately mastered by it instead.***

- When she first met Max, Amy thought he was cool, rebellious, and kind of punky - different from the usual Boise crowd. But as they spent every free moment together, she began to see a darker, obsessive side to his personality, particularly after he introduced her to the Internet and TinyMUD. 

- ***Max did nothing in half measures***, and his devotion to Amy was absolute. She planned on attending Boise State University, so Max applied there, postponing his dream of attending CMU or MIT. He brought her home to meet his computer, and the couple played Tetris together. Their relationship was everything his parents’ hadn’t been. They both thought it would never end.
