# 3. The Hungry Programmers

- Max walked into Hungry Manor with few belongings but lots of baggage.

- Everyone was going online; Max was no longer the weirdo, addicted to a network nobody had heard of. Now, it turned out, he’d been at the head of a pack that was growing to include millions of people.

- Max fancied himself an invisible, spectral presence in cyberspace. He chose “Ghost23” as his IRC Identity - 23 was his lucky number, and among other meanings it was the I Ching hexagram representing chaos.

-  Recreational hackers were no longer a target for the bureau, he said. There was a new, more dangerous breed of computer criminal emerging: “real” criminals. They were cyberthieves, pedophiles, even terrorists.
