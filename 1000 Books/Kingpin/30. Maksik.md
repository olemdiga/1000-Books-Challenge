# 30. Maksik

- As Digits, Max was now regarded by some carders as the second-most-successful magstripe vendor in the world.

- Carders like Maksik and Max were at the fore in embracing one of the unheralded gifts of the computer revolution: ***cryptography software so strong that, in theory, even the NSA couldn’t crack it***.

- In the 1990s the Justice Department and Louis Freeh’s FBI had tried hard to make such encryption illegal in the United States, fearing that it would be embraced by organized crime, pedophiles, terrorists, and hackers.

- But the feds lost the crypto wars, and by 2005 unbreakable crypto was widely available to anyone who wanted it. The predictions of doom had largely failed to materialize; most criminals weren’t tech-savvy enough to adopt encryption.

- Max, though, was. If all his tradecraft failed and the feds crashed through his safe house door, they’d find everything he accumulated in his crimes, from credit card numbers to hacking code, scrambled with an Israeli-made encryption program called DriveCrypt - 1,344-bit military-grade crypto he’d purchased for about $60.
- Nothing had been left to chance - Max was certain. He was untouchable.
