# 35. Sentencing

- ***For years, Max had used his encrypted hard drive as an extension of his brain, storing everything he found and everything he did.*** That the feds had it was disastrous for his legal future, but more than that, it felt like an intimate violation. The government was in his head, reading his mind and memories. When he returned to his cell after the hearing, he wept into his pillow.

- They had everything: five terabytes of hacking tools, phishing e-mails, dossiers he’d compiled on his online friends and enemies, notes on his interests and activities, and 1.8 million credit cards accounts from over a thousand banks. The government broke it down: Max had stolen 1.1 million of the cards from point-of-sale systems. The remainder mostly came from the carders Max had hacked.

- He continued. ***“I have a lot of regrets, but I think my essential failing was that I lost touch with the accountability and responsibility that comes with being a member of society. A friend of mine once told me to behave as though everyone could see what I was doing all the time.*** A sure way to avoid engaging in illegal conduct, but I guess I wasn’t a believer because when I was invisible, I forgot all about this advice. I know now that we can’t be invisible, and that it’s dangerous thinking.”
