# 11. Operators

- An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. 
- C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators:
	- Arithmetic Operators
	- Relational Operators
	- Logical Operators
	- Bitwise Operators
	- Assignment Operators
	- Misc Operators
## Arithmetic Operators

There are following arithmetic operators supported by C++ language:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| +        |             |
| \*       |             |
| /        |             |
| %        |             |
| ++       |             |
## Relational Operators

- There are following relational operators supported by C++ language:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ==       |             |
| !=       |             |
| >        |             |
| <        |             |
| >=       |             |
| <=       |             |
## Logical Operators

- There are following logical operators supported by C++ language:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| &&       |             |
| \|\|     |             |
| !        |             |
## Bitwise Operators

- Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. 
- The truth tables for &, |, and ^ are as follows:

| p   | q   | p&q | p\|q | p^q |
| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0    | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1    | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1    | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1    | 1   |
- The Bitwise operators supported by C++ language are listed in the following table:

| Operator | Description                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &        | Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.                                             |
| \|       | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.                                                           |
| ^        | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.                                              |
| ~        | Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.                                           |
| <<       | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.   |
| >>       | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. |
## Assignment Operators

- There are following assignment operators supported by C++ language:

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| =        |             |
| +=       |             |
| -=       |             |
| \*=      |             |
| /=       |             |
| %=       |             |
| <<=      |             |
| >>=      |             |
| &=       |             |
| ^=       |             |
| \|=      |             |
## Misc Operators

- The following table lists some other operators that C++ supports.

| Operator                    | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |

| \*                          |             |
## Operators Precedence in C++

- Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others.

- Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.
