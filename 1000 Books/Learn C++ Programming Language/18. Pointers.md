# 18. Pointers

- Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.
## What are Pointers?

- A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
- The general form of a pointer variable declaration is:
```cpp
type *var-name;
```
- Here, ***type*** is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable.
- In this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer.
- The actual data type of the value of all pointers is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
## Using Pointers in C++

- There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. 
	1. We define a pointer variable.
	2. Assign the address of a variable to a pointer.
	3. Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator `*` that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.
## Pointers in C++

- The following important pointer concepts should be clear to a C++ programmer:

| Concept                       | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Null Pointers                 | C++ supports null pointer, which is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.                                   |
| Pointer arithmetic            | There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: `++, --, +, -`                                                             |
| Pointers vs Arrays            | There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays.                                                                                   |
| Array of pointers             | You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.                                                                                          |
| Pointer to Pointer            | C++ allows you to have pointer pointing at another pointer.                                                                                  |
| Passing pointers to functions | Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function. |
| Return pointer from functions | C++ allows a function to return a pointer to local variable, static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well.                       |
