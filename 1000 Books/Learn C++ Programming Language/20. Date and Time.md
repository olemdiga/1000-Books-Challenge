# 20. Date and Time

- The C++ standard library does not provide a proper date type. C++ inherits the structs and functions for date and time manipulation from C. To access date and time related functions and structures, you would need to include `<ctime>` header file in your C++ program.

- There are four time-related types: **`clock_t`**, **`time_t`**, **`size_t`**, and **`tm`**. 
- The types - `clock_t`, `size_t` and `time_t` are capable of representing the system time and date as some sort of integer.

- The structure type **`tm`** holds the date and time in the form of a C structure having the following elements:
```cpp
struct tm {
	int tm_sec;    // seconds of minutes from 0 to 61
	int tm_min;    // minutes of hour from 0 to 59
	int tm_hour;   // hours of day from 0 to 24
	int tm_mday;   // day of month from 1 to 31
	int tm_mon;    // month of year from 0 to 11
	int tm_year;   // year since 1900
	int tm_wday;   // days since sunday
	int tm_yday;   // days since January 1st
	int tm_isdst; // hours of daylight savings time
}
```

- Following are the important functions, which we use while working with date and time in C or C++. All these functions are part of standard C and C++ library.

| SN  | Function                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `time_t time(time_t *time);`                      | This returns the current calendar time of the system in number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970. If the system has no time, .1 is returned.                                |
| 2   | `char *ctime(const time_t *time);`                | This returns a pointer to a string of the form day month year hours:minutes:seconds year\n\0.                                                                                      |
| 3   | `struct tm *localtime(const time_t *time);`       | This returns a pointer to the tm structure representing local time.                                                                                                                |
| 4   | `clock_t clock(void);`                            | This returns a value that approximates the amount of time the calling program has been running. A value of .1 is returned if the time is not available.                            |
| 5   | `char * asctime ( const struct tm * time );`      | This returns a pointer to a string that contains the information stored in the structure pointed to by time converted into the form: day month date hours:minutes:seconds year\n\0 |
| 6   | `struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *time);`          | This returns a pointer to the time in the form of a **tm** structure. The time is represented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is essentially Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). |
| 7   | `time_t mktime(struct tm *time);`                 | This returns the calendar-time equivalent of the time found in the structure pointed to by time.                                                                                   |
| 8   | `double difftime ( time_t time2, time_t time1 );` | This function calculates the difference in seconds between time1 and time2.                                                                                                        |
| 9   | `size_t strftime();`                              | This function can be used to format date and time in a specific format.                                                                                                            |
## Format Time using struct tm

- The **tm** structure is very important while working with date and time in either C or C++. This structure holds the date and time in the form of a C structure as mentioned above. Most of the time related functions makes use of **tm** structure.
