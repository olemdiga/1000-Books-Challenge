# 21. Basic Input-Output

- The C++ standard libraries provide an extensive set of input/output capabilities.

- C++ I/O occurs in streams, which are sequences of bytes.
- If bytes flow from a device like a keyboard, a disk drive, or a network connection etc. to main memory, this is called ***input operation***
- If bytes flow from main memory to a device like a display screen, a printer, a disk drive, or a network connection, etc., this is called ***output operation***.

| `<iostream>` | This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which<br>correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output<br>stream, the un-buffered standard error stream and the<br>buffered standard error stream, respectively. |
| `<iomanip>`  | This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O<br>with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such<br>as ***setw*** and ***setprecision***.                                                                      |
| `<fstream>`  | This file declares services for user-controlled file processing.                                                                                                                                                                        |
