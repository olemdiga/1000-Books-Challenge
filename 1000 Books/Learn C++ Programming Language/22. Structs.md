# 22. Structs

## Defining a Struct

- Struct is another user defined data type which allows you to combine data items of different kinds.
- Structs are used to represent a record.
- Struct has the following Syntax:
```cpp
struct [structure tag]
{
member definition;
member definition;
...
member definition;
} [one or more structure variables];
```

- The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. 
- Here is the way you would declare the Book structure:
```cpp
struct Books{
	char title[50];
	char author[50];
	char subject[100];
	int book_id;
}book;
```
## Accessing Structs Members

- To access any member of a structure, we use the ***member access operator*** (`.`). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. 
- You would use `struct` keyword to define variables of structure type.
## structs as Function Arguments

- You can pass a struct as a function argument in very similar way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
## Pointers to Structs

- You can define pointers to structures in very similar way as you define pointer to any other variable.
