# 28. Data Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of ***data hiding***.
- **Data encapsulation** is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and **data abstraction** is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.
- C++ supports the properties of encapsulation and data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called **classes**.
-  By default, all items defined in a class are `private`. 

- Making one class a friend of another, exposes the implementation details and reduces encapsulation. The ideal is to keep as many of the details of each class hidden from all other classes as possible.
## Designing Strategy

- Most of us have learnt to make class members `private` by default unless we really need to expose them. That's just good encapsulation. 
- This is applied most frequently to data members, but it applies equally to all members, including virtual functions.
