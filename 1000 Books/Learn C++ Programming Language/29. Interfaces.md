# 29. Interfaces

- The C++ interfaces are implemented using ***abstract classes***.
- A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing `= 0` in its declaration.

- The purpose of an abstract class is to provide an appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects and serves only as an interface.

- If a subclass of an Abstract Class needs to be instantiated, it has to implement each of the virtual functions, which means that it supports the interface declared by the Abstract Class. Failure to override a pure virtual function in a derived class, then attempting to instantiate objects of that class, is a compilation error.
- Classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called ***concrete classes***.
