# 32. Dynamic Memory

- A good understanding of how dynamic memory really works in C++ is essential to becoming a good C++ programmer. Memory in your C++ program is divided into two parts:
	- The ***stack***: All variables declared inside the function will take up memory from the stack.
	- The ***heap***: This is unused memory of the program and can be used to allocate the memory dynamically when program runs.

- Many times, you are not aware in advance how much memory you will need to store particular information in a defined variable and the size of required memory can be determined at run time.

- You can allocate memory at run time within the heap for the variable of a given type using a special operator in C++ which returns the address of the space allocated. This operator is called `new` operator.
- If you are not in need of dynamically allocated memory anymore, you can use `delete` operator, which de-allocates memory previously allocated by `new` operator.
