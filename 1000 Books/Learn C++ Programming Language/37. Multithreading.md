# 37. Multithreading

- ***Multithreading*** is a specialized form of multitasking and a multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two types of multitasking: **process**-based and **thread**-based.

- Process-based multitasking handles the concurrent execution of programs.
- Thread-based multitasking deals with the concurrent execution of pieces of the same program.

- A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.

- The maximum number of threads that may be created by a process is implementation dependent. Once created, threads are peers, and may create other threads. There is no implied hierarchy or dependency between threads.
