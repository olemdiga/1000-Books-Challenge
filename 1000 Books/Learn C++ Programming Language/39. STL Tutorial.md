# 39. STL Tutorial

-  The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
- At the core of the C++ Standard Template Library are following three well-structured components:

| Component  | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Containers | Containers are used to manage collections of objects<br>of a certain kind. There are several different types of<br>containers like deque, list, vector, map etc.            |
| Algorithms | Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means<br>by which you will perform initialization, sorting,<br>searching, and transforming of the contents of<br>containers. |
| Iterators  | Iterators are used to step through the elements of<br>collections of objects. These collections may be<br>containers or subsets of containers.                              |
- All the three components have a rich set of pre-defined functions which help us in doing complicated tasks in very easy fashion.

-  Various functions to use
	- The `push_back( )` member function inserts value at the end of the `vector`, expanding its size as needed.
	- The size( )`size( )` function displays the size of the `vector`.
	- The function `begin( )` returns an iterator to the start of the `vector`.
	- The function `end( )` returns an iterator to the end of the `vector`.
