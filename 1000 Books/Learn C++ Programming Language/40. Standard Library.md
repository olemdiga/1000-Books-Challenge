# 40. Standard Library

- The C++ Standard Library can be categorized into two parts:
	- **The Standard Function Library**: This library consists of general-purpose, stand-alone functions that are not part of any class. The function library is inherited from C.
	- The Object Oriented Class Library: This is a collection of classes and associated functions.

- Standard C++ Library incorporates all the Standard C libraries also, with small additions and changes to support type safety.
## The Standard Function Library

- The standard function library is divided into the following categories:
	- I/O,
	- String and character handling,
	- Mathematical,
	- Time, date, and localization,
	- Dynamic allocation,
	- Miscellaneous,
	- Wide-character functions
## The Object Oriented Class Library

- Standard C++ Object Oriented Library defines an extensive set of classes that provide support for a number of common activities, including I/O, strings, and numeric processing. This library includes the following:
	- The Standard C++ I/O Classes
	- The String Class
	- The Numeric Classes
	- The STL Container Classes
	- The STL Algorithms
	- The STL Function Objects
	- The STL Iterators
	- The STL Allocators
	- The Localization library
	- Exception Handling Classes
	- Miscellaneous Support Library
