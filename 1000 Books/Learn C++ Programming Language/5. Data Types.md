# 5. Data Types

## Primitive Built-in Types

- C++ offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user defined data types. Following table lists down seven basic C++ data types:

| Type                  | Keyword   |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Boolean               | `bool`    |
| Character             | `char`    |
| Integer               | `int`     |
| Floating point        | `float`   |
| Double floating point | `double`  |
| Valueless             | `void`    |
| Wide character        | `wchar_t` |
- Several of the basic types can be modified using one or more of these type modifiers:
	- `signed`
	- `unsigned`
	- `short`
	- `long`

- The following table shows the variable type, how much memory it takes to store the value in memory, and what is maximum and minimum value which can be stored in such type of variables.

| Type                 | Typical Bit Width | Typical Range                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `char`               | 1byte             | -127 to 127 or 0 to 255         |
| `unsigned char`      | 1byte             | 0 to 255                        |
| `signed char`        | 1byte             | -127 to 127                     |
| `int`                | 4bytes            | -2147483648 to 2147483647       |
| `unsigned int`       | 4bytes            | 0 to 4294967295                 |
| `signed int`         | 4bytes            | -2147483648 to 2147483647       |
| `short int`          | 2bytes            | -32768 to 32767                 |
| `unsigned short int` | Range             | 0 to 65,535                     |
| `signed short int`   | Range             | -32768 to 32767                 |
| `long int`           | 4bytes            | -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `signed long int`    | 4bytes            | same as long int                |
| `unsigned long int`  | 4bytes            | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |
| `float`              | 4bytes            | +/- 3.4e +/- 38 (~7 digits)     |
| `double`             | 8bytes            | +/- 1.7e +/- 308 (~15 digits)   |
| `long double`        | 8bytes            | +/- 1.7e +/- 308 (~15 digits)   |
| `wchar_t`            | 2 or 4 bytes      | 1 wide character                |

- The size of variables might be different from those shown in the above table, depending on the compiler and the computer you are using.

## typedef Declarations

- You can create a new name for an existing type using `typedef`. Following is the simple syntax to define a new type using `typedef`:
```cpp
typedef type newname;
```

- For example, the following tells the compiler that feet is another name for `int`:
```cpp
typedef int feet;
```

- Now, the following declaration is perfectly legal and creates an integer variable called distance:
```cpp
feet distance;
```

## Enumerated Types

- An enumerated type declares an optional type name and a set of zero or more identifiers that can be used as values of the type. Each enumerator is a constant whose type is the enumeration.
- Creating an enumeration requires the use of the keyword `enum`. The general form of an enumeration type is:
```cpp
enum enum-name { list of names } var-list;
```

- Here, the enum-name is the enumeration's type name. The list of names is comma separated.
- For example, the following code defines an enumeration of colors called colors and the variable c of type color. Finally, c is assigned the value "blue".
```cpp
enum color { red, green, blue } c;
c = blue;
```

- By default, the value of the first name is 0, the second name has the value 1, and the third has the value 2, and so on. But you can give a name, a specific value by adding an initializer.
-  For example, in the following enumeration, green will have the value 5.
```cpp
enum color { red, green=5, blue };
```

- Here, blue will have a value of 6 because each name will be one greater than the one that precedes it.
