# 8. Constants-Literals

- Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called ***literals.***
- Again, constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
## Character Literals

- Character literals are enclosed in single quotes. If the literal begins with `L` (uppercase only), it is a wide character literal (e.g., `L'x'`) and should be stored in `wchar_t` type of variable. Otherwise, it is a narrow character literal (e.g., `'x'`) and can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
- A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., `'x'`), an escape sequence (e.g., `'\t'`), or a universal character (e.g., `'\u02C0'`).
## Defining Constants

- There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants:
	- Using `#define` preprocessor.
	- Using `const` keyword.
### The \#define Preprocessor

- Following is the form to use `#define` preprocessor to define a constant:
```cpp
#define identifier value
```
### The const Keyword

- You can use `const` prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows:
```cpp
const type variable = value;
```

- Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.
