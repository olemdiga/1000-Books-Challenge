# 9. Modifier Types

- C++ allows the `char`, `int`, and `double` data types to have modifiers preceding them. A modifier is used to alter the meaning of the base type so that it more precisely fits the needs of various situations.
- The data type modifiers are listed here:
	- `signed`
	- `unsigned`
	- `long`
	- `short`

- The modifiers `signed`, `unsigned`, `long`, and `short` can be applied to integer base types.
- `signed` and `unsigned` can be applied to `char`, and `long` can be applied to `double`.
- The modifiers `signed` and `unsigned` can also be used as prefix to `long` or `short` modifiers. For example, `unsigned long int`.

- C++ allows a shorthand notation for declaring `unsigned`, `short`, or `long` integers. You can simply use the word `unsigned`, `short`, or `long`, without `int`. It automatically implies `int`.
## Type Qualifiers in C++

- The type qualifiers provide additional information about the variables they precede.

| Qualifier  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `const`    | Objects of type **const** cannot be changed by your program during<br>execution                                                                                           |
| `volatile` | The modifier **volatile** tells the compiler that a variable's value may<br>be changed in ways not explicitly specified by the program.                                   |
| `restrict` | A pointer qualified by restrict is initially the only means by which<br>the object it points to can be accessed. Only C99 adds a new type<br>qualifier called `restrict`. |
