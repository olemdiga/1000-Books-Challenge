# Introduction

- To me, C++ is a wonderful product of the human intellect. Over the years, I have certainly come to think of it as a thing of beauty and elegance. C++ is a language like no other, surprising in its complexity yet wonderfully sleek and elegant in so many ways. It is also a language that cannot be learned by guessing, one that is easy to get wrong and challenging to get right.
- In this book, we will get familiar with the language basics first. Then, we will move on to classes, templates, and the C++ Standard Library. 
- Once we got these covered, we will describe the modern C++ standards in more detail.
