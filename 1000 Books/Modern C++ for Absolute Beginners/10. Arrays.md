# 10. Arrays

- Arrays are sequences of objects of the same type. 
- We can access individual array elements through a subscript `[]` operator and an index. The first array element has an index of `0`.

- ***Note***: In modern C++, we should prefer the `std::array` and `std::vector` containers to raw arrays.
