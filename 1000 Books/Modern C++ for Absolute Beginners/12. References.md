# 12. References

- A reference type is *an alias to an existing object in memory*.
- References must be initialized. 
- We describe a reference type as type_name followed by an ampersand `&`.
- Example:
```cpp
int main(){
	int x = 123;
	int& y = x;
}
```

- Now we have two different names that refer to the same int object in memory.
- If we assign a different value to either one of them, the objectâ€™s value will change as we have one object in memory, but we are using two different names.

- Another concept is a const reference, a read-only alias to some object. Example:
```cpp
int main(){
	int x = 123;
	const int& y = x; // const reference
	x = 456;  
	// both x and y now hold the value of 456
}
```

- We will discuss references and const reference in more detail when we learn about functions and function parameters. For now, let us assume they are an alias, a different/additional name we give to our existing object.

- ***Note***:
	- It is important not to confuse the use of `*` in a pointer type declaration such as `int*` p; and the use of `*` when dereferencing a pointer such as *p = 456. Although the same star character, it is used in two different contexts.
	- It is important not to confuse the use of ampersand `&` in reference type declaration such as `int& y = x;` and the use of ampersand as an address-of operator such as `int* p = &x;`. The same literal symbol is used for two different things.
