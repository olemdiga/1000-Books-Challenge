# 14. Automatic Type Deduction

- We can automatically deduce the type of an object using the auto specifier. The `auto` specifier deduces the type of an object based on the objectâ€™s initializer type.
- We can use `auto` as part of the reference type or as part of the constant type.

- We use the `auto` specifier when the type (name) is hard to deduce manually or cumbersome to type due to its length.
