# 17. Constants

- When we want to have a read-only object or promise not to change the value of some object in the current scope, we make it a constant. C++ uses the `const` type qualifier to mark the object as a read-only. We say that our object is now *immutable*.
- Constants are not modifiable. Attempting to modify their values results in a compile-Â­time error.
- An object declared `const` cannot be assigned to, it can only be initialized. 

- Worth noticing is that `const` modifies an entire type, not just the object. So, `const int` and `int` are two different types. The first one is said to be `const `qualified.

- Another `const` qualifier is the constant expression named `constexpr`. It is a constant that can be evaluated at compile time. Initializers for constant expressions can be evaluated at compile time and must themselves be constant expressions.
- Example:
```cpp
int main(){
	constexpr int n = 123;    //OK, 123 is a compile-time constant expression
	constexpr double d = 456.78;    //OK, 456.78 is a compile-time constant 
									//expression
	constexpr double d2 = d;    //OK, d is a constant expression
	int x = 123;
	constexpr int n2 = x;   //compile-time error 
							// the value of x is not known during
							// compile-time
}
```
