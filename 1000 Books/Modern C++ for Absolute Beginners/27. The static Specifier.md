# 27. The static Specifier

- The `static` specifier says the object will have a static storage duration. The memory space for `static` objects is allocated when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends. Only one instance of a `static` object exists in the program. If a local variable is marked as `static`, the space for it is allocated the first time the program control encounters its definition and deallocated when the program exits.

- This variable is initialized the first time the program encounters this function. The value of this variable is preserved across function calls. What does this mean? The last changes we made to it stay. It will not get initialized to zero for every function call, only the first time.

- This is convenient as we do not have to store the value inside some global variable `x`. We can define `static` class member fields. Static class members are not part of the object. They live independently of an object of a class. We declare a static data member inside the class and define it outside the class only once.

- To define a static member function, we prepend the function declaration with the `static` keyword. The function definition outside the class does not use the `static` keyword:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass{
	public:
	static void myfunction(); // declare a static member function
};

// define a static member function
void MyClass::myfunction(){
	std::cout << "Hello World from a static member function.";
}

int main(){
	MyClass::myfunction(); // call a static member function
}
```
