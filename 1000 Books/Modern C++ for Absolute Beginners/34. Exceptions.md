# 34. Exceptions

- If an error occurs in our program, we want to be able to handle it in some way. One way to do this is through ***exceptions***.
- Exceptions are mechanisms where we try to execute some code in the try{} block, and if an error occurs, an exception is thrown. The control is then transferred to a catch clause, which handles that exception.

- A structure of a try/catch block would be:
```cpp
int main(){
	try{
		// your code here
		// throw an exception if there is an error
	}
	catch (type_of_the_exception e){
		// catch and handle the exception
	}
}
```

- We can raise multiple exceptions. They can be of different types.
- When we are throwing multiple exceptions inside the try block. The control is transferred to an appropriate catch clause when a first exception is encountered.
