# 37. Input/Output Streams

- We can convert our objects to streams of bytes. We can also convert streams of bytes back to objects. The I/O stream library provides such functionality.
- Streams can be output streams and input streams.

- Remember the `std::cout` and `std::cin`? Those are also streams.
	- For example, the `std::cout` is an output stream. It takes whatever objects we supply to it and converts them to a byte stream, which then goes to our monitor. 
	- Conversely, `std::cin` is an input stream. It takes the input from the keyboard and converts that input to our objects.

- There are different kinds of I/O streams, and here we will explain two kinds: file streams and string streams.
## File Streams

- We can read from a file, and we can write to a file. The standard library offers such functionality via file streams.
- Those file streams are defined inside the `<fstream>` header, and they are
	1. `std::ifstream` – Read from a file
	2. `std::ofstream` – Write to a file
	3. `std::fstream` – Read from and write to a file

- To create a `std::fstream` object, we use
```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main(){
	std::fstream fs{ "myfile.txt" };
}
```

- This example creates a file stream called fs and associates it with a file name `myfile.txt` on our disk.
- To read from such file, line by line, we use
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main(){
	std::fstream fs{ "myfile.txt" };
	std::string s;

	while (fs){
		std::getline(fs, s); // read each line into a string
		`std::cout` << s << '\n';
	}
}
```

- Once associated with a file name, we use our fs file stream to read each line of text from the file and print it out on a screen. To do that, we declare a string variable s, which will hold our read line of text. Inside the while loop, we read a line from a file to a string. This is why the `std::getline` function accepts a file stream and a string as arguments.
- Once read, we output the text line on a screen. The while loop terminates once we reach the end of the file.

- To read from a file, one character at a time, we can use the file stream’s >> operator:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main(){ 
	std::fstream fs{ "myfile.txt" };
	char c;

	while (fs >> c){
	`std::cout` << c;
	}
}
```

- This example reads the file contents one character at a time into our char variable. By default, this skips the reading of white spaces. To rectify this, we add the `std::noskipws` manipulator.
- To write to a file, we use the file stream’s insertion << operator:
```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main(){
	std::fstream fs{ "myoutputfile.txt", std::ios::out };
	fs << "First line of text." << '\n';
	fs << "Second line of text." << '\n';
	fs << "The third line of text." << '\n';
}
```

- To write to a file, we use the file stream’s insertion `<<` operator:
```cpp
#include <fstream>

int main(){
	std::fstream fs{ "myoutputfile.txt", std::ios::out };
	fs << "First line of text." << '\n';
	fs << "Second line of text." << '\n';
	fs << "The third line of text." << '\n';
}
```

- We associate an fs object with an output file name and provide an additional `std::ios::out` flag which opens a file for writing and overwrites any existing `myoutputfile.txt` file. Then we output our text to a file stream using the `<<` operator.
- To append text to an existing file, we include the `std::ios::app` flag inside the file stream constructor.

- We can also output strings to our file using the file stream’s `<<` operator:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main(){
	std::fstream fs{ "myoutputfile.txt", std::ios::out };
	std::string s1 = "The first string.\n";
	std::string s2 = "The second string.\n";
	fs << s1 << s2;
}
```

## String Streams

- Similarly, there is a stream that allows us to read from and write to a string. It is defined inside the `<sstream>` header, and there are three different string streams:
	1. `std::istringstream` – The stream to read from a string
	2. `std::ostringstream` – The stream to write to a string
	3. `std::stringstream` – The stream to both read from and write to a string 

- To create a simple string stream, we use
```cpp
#include <sstream>

int main(){
	std::stringstream ss;
}
```

- To create a string stream and initialize it with a string literal, we use
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main(){
	std::stringstream ss{ "Hello World." };
	`std::cout` << ss.str();
}
```

- Here, we created a string stream and initialized it with a string literal in a constructor. Then we used the string stream’s `.str()` member function to print the content of the stream.

- To initialize a string stream with a string, we use
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<sstream>

int main(){
	std::stringstream ss;
	ss << "Hello World.";
	`std::cout` << ss.str();
}
```

- We use the string stream’s member function `.str()` to assign the string stream’s
content to a string variable:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

int main(){
	std::stringstream ss{ "Hello World from a string stream." };
	std::string s = ss.str();
	`std::cout` << s;
}
```

- To insert data into a string stream, we use the formatted output operator `<<`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

int main(){
	std::string s = "Hello World.";
	std::stringstream ss{ s };
	`std::cout` << ss.str();
}
```

- We can also insert values of fundamental types into a string stream using the formatted output operator `<<`.

- To output data from a stream into an object, we use the `>>` operator:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main(){
	std::string s = "A 123 456.78";
	std::stringstream ss{ s };
	char c;
	int x;
	double d;
	ss >> c >> x >> d;
	`std::cout` << c << ' ' << x << ' ' << d << ' ';
}
```

- This example reads data from a string stream into our variables. String streams are useful for formatted input/output and when we want to convert from built-in types to a string and from a string to built-in types.
