# 38. C++ Standard Library and Friends

- The C++ language is accompanied by a library called the ***C++ Standard Library.*** 
- It is a collection of containers and useful functions that we access and use in our program by including the proper header file. 
- The containers and functions inside the C++ Standard Library are defined in the std namespace.
-  The standard library is implemented through class templates. In short, prefer using the standard library to user-provided libraries for everyday tasks.

- Some functionalities explained in this chapter, such as range-based for loop and lambda expressions, are part of the language itself, not the standard library. The reason we put them here is they are mostly used in conjunction with standard library facilities.
