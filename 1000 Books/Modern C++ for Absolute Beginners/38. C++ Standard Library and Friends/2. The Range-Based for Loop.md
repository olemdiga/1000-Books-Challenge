# The Range-Based for Loop

- Now is an excellent time to introduce the range-based `for` loop, which allows us to iterate over the container/range content. 
- The range-based `for` loop is of the following syntax:
```cpp
for (some_type element_name : container_name)
{
}
```

- We read it as for each element_name of some_type inside the container_name (do something inside the code block `{}`).
-  If we want to operate on the actual container elements, we use a reference type.
```cpp
for (int& el : v)
{
}
```

- Now, `el` is the actual container element, so any changes we make on `el` will be the changes to the actual container elements.
- We can also use the `auto` specifier and let the compiler deduce the type of the elements in the container.

- To iterate over a vector of strings, we would use a `const auto&` specifier, as we should pass strings via `const` reference for performance reasons.
