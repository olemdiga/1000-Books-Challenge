# Iterators


- Containers have iterators. Iterators are pointer-like entities capable of pointing to individual container elements. 
- The iterator pointing at the first element of a vector is expressed through a `.begin()` member function. The iterator pointing at the (not the last but) one past the last element is expressed through a `.end()` member function.

- Iterators can be incremented or decremented.

- Please note that due to the nature of the vector’s implementation, it is not sufficient only to use the `.erase` function to remove the element from the container. Instead, we should use the so-called ***erase-remove*** idiom for vectors.

- A call to `std::remove` is usually followed by a call to the container’s `.erase` member function, thus ensuring the proper removal/deletion of the container’s element.

- We also mentioned another group of containers called ***associative containers.***
- These containers are implemented as ***binary trees***. 
- They allow for quick search times, and the data in these containers are sorted.
- These associative containers are `std::set` and `std::map`. 
- The ***set*** holds unique values. 
- The ***map*** holds pairs of key-value elements. Maps hold unique keys.

- Please note that there is also another group of associative containers that allow for duplicate values. They are `std::multiset` and `std::multimap`.
