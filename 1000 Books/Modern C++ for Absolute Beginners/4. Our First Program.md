# 4. Our First Program

- The `iostream` header is part of the standard library. We need its inclusion to be able to use the `std::cout` object, also known as the ***standard output stream***.
- The `<<` operator, called the ***stream insertion operator***.
-  A string literal is enclosed in double quotes `" "`.
- The `;` marks the end of the statement.
- The `std` is the standard library namespace.
- `::` is the ***scope resolution operator***.

- To output data on a new line, we need to output a newline character `\n` literal.
- A single character literal, including the escape sequence characters in C++, is enclosed in single quotes '', like 'a', 'B', 'c', '\\n', etc.
## Do not use using namespace std;

- Many examples on the Web introduce the entire `std namespace` into the current scope via the `using namespace std`; statement only to be able to type cout instead of the `std::cout`. While this might save us from typing five additional characters, it is wrong for many reasons. We do not want to introduce the entire std namespace into the current scope because we want to avoid name clashes and ambiguity.

- For calls to objects and functions residing inside the `std` namespace, add the `std::` prefix where needed.
