# Project I - Book Inventory

- Write a program that manages a book inventory. Requirements:
	- Create a Book class with basic functionality (two data members, two constructors, a couple of getters and setters, and an arbitrary utility member function).
	- In function main, create a single instance of a Book class using a default constructor.
	- In function main, create a single instance of a Book class using a user-provided constructor and invoke the member functions.
	- In function main, create a container of multiple Book objects using `std::vector`.
	- Iterate through a container and invoke at least one member function.
