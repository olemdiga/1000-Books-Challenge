# Project III - Message Logger

- Write a program that creates a message logger. The logging functionality will be implemented inside a MyLogger class. The main function creates an instance of a class and logs messages to a console window and a file. Requirements:
- Implement the following methods:
	- `void logToFile(...)` – A member function that logs a message to a file
	- `void logToConsole(...)` – A member function that logs a message to a console window
	- `void logWithLevel(...)` – A member function that logs a message using the specific verbosity level
	- `void logToAll(...)` – A member function that logs a message both to a console window and a file

-  Implement at least two constructors.
- Disable the copy semantics for the MyLogger class.
- Implement the move semantics for the MyLogger class.
- In function main, create an instance of a MyLogger class and log messages using member functions.
