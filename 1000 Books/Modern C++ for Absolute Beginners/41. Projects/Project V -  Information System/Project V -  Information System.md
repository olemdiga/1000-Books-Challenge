# Project V - Information System

- Write a program that represents an employee’s information system. The system is implemented as a container of polymorphic objects. Requirements:
	-  Create a base class called Person, having multiple constructors and at least one virtual member function.
	- Create a derived class called Employee, extending the Person’s functionality. The Employee class overrides the virtual member function from the base class.
	- Wrap the classes into a namespace.
	- Both classes support the copy and move semantics.
	- In function main, create a container of multiple polymorphic objects (pointers). Iterate through a container and invoke at least one member function.
