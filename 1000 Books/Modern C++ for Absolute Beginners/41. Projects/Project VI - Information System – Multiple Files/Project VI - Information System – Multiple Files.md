# Project VI - Information System – Multiple Files

- Write a program that splits the code from Project V into multiple (source and header) files. Additional requirements:
	- Put the Person class declaration inside a person.h header file. Implement header guards.
	- Put the Employee class declaration inside an employee.h header file. Implement header guards.
	- Put the Person class definition inside a person.cpp source file. Include the person.h header file into a person.cpp source file.
	- Put the Employee class definition inside an employee.cpp source file. Include the employee.h header file into a person.cpp source file.
	- In the main program file called source.cpp, include the employee.h header file and create a vector of polymorphic objects.
	- Include additional header files where appropriate.
	- Wrap the classes’ code inside a namespace nm.
	- Compile all the source files and run the program.
