# 8. Standard Input

- C++ provides facilities for accepting input from a user. 
- The `std::cin` is the standard input stream, and it uses the ***stream extraction `>>` operator*** to extract what has been read into our variable.
- We can accept multiple values from the standard input by separating them with multiple `>>` operators.
