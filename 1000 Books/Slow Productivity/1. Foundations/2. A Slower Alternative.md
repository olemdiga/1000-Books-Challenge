# 2. A Slower Alternative

## The Slowness Revolution

- There’s a personal satisfaction in grimly pointing out the flaws in a system, but sustainable change, requires providing people with an enjoyable and life-affirming alternative.
## In Search of a Better Alternative

- ***Knowledge Work (General Definition)*** - The economic activity in which knowledge is transformed into an artifact with market value through the application of cognitive effort.
## A New Philosophy

- ***Slow Productivity*** - A philosophy for organizing knowledge work efforts in a sustainable and meaningful manner, based on the following three principles: 
	1. Do fewer things.
	2. Work at a natural pace.
	3. Obsess over quality.

- Humans derive great satisfaction from being good at what they do and producing useful things. This philosophy can be understood as providing a more sustainable path toward these achievements.

- ***Few people know, for example, how long it actually took Isaac Newton to develop all the ideas contained in his masterwork, the Principia (over twenty years). They just know that his book, once published, changed science forever. The value of his ideas lives on, while the lazy pace at which they were produced was soon forgotten. Slow productivity supports legacy-building accomplishments but allows them to unfold at a more human speed.***
