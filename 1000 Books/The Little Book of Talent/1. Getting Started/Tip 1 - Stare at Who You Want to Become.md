## Tip 1 - Stare at Who You Want to Become 

- Studies show that even a brief connection with a role model can vastly increase unconscious motivation.
- You say to yourself, ‘If he can do it, why can’t I?’
- Use pictures or, better, video of people who inspire you to motivate yourself.

> **One idea:** Bookmark a few YouTube videos, and watch them before you practice, or at night before you go to bed.
