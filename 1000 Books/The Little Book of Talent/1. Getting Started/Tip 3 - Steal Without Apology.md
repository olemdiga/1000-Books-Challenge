## Tip 3 - Steal Without Apology

- All improvement is about absorbing and applying new information, and the best source of information is top performers. So steal it.
-  “Good artists borrow. Great artists steal.” ~ Pablo Picasso
- Look at every single performer better than you and see what they’ve got that you can use. Then make it your own.
