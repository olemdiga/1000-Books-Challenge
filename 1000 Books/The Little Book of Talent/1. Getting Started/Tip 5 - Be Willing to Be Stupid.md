## Tip 5 - Be Willing to Be Stupid

- Feeling stupid is no fun. But being willing to be stupid - in other words, being willing to risk the emotional pain of making mistakes - is absolutely essential, because reaching, failing, and reaching again is the way your brain grows and forms new connections.
- When it comes to developing talent, remember, mistakes are not really mistakes - they are the guideposts you use to get better.

- ***Once a week, you should make a decision at work that scares you.***
- Whatever the strategy, the goal is always the same - to encourage reaching, and to reinterpret mistakes so that theyâ€™re not verdicts, but the information you use to navigate to the correct move.
