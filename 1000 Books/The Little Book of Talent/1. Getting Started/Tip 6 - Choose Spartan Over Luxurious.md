## Tip 6 - Choose Spartan Over Luxurious

- We love comfort. We love state-of-the-art practice facilities, oak-paneled corner offices, spotless locker rooms, and fluffy towels. Which is a shame, because luxury is a motivational narcotic - ***It signals our unconscious minds to give less effort. It whispers, Relax, youâ€™ve made it.***

- Simple, humble spaces help focus attention on the deep-practice task at hand - reaching and repeating and struggling. When given the choice between luxurious and spartan, choose spartan. Your unconscious mind will thank you.
