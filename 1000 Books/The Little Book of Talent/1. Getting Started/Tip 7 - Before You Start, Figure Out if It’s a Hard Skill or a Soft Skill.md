## Tip 7 - Before You Start, Figure Out if It’s a Hard Skill or a Soft Skill

> The first step toward building a skill is to figure out exactly what type of skill you’re building. Every skill falls into one of two categories - **hard skills** and **soft skills.**

- ***HARD, HIGH-PRECISION SKILLS*** are actions that are performed as correctly and consistently as possible, every time. They are skills that have one path to an ideal result; skills that you could imagine being performed by a reliable robot. Hard skills are about repeatable precision, and tend to be found in specialized pursuits, particularly physical ones.
	- Here, your goal is to build a skill that functions like a Swiss watch - reliable, exact, and performed the same way every time, automatically, without fail. Hard skills are about **Always Being Consistent**.

- ***SOFT, HIGH-FLEXIBILITY SKILLS*** on the other hand, are those that have many paths to a good result, not just one. These skills aren’t about doing the same thing perfectly every time, but rather about being agile and interactive; about instantly recognizing patterns asthey unfold and making smart, timely choices. Soft skills tend to be found in broader, less specialized pursuits, especially those that involve communication.
	- With these skills, we are not trying for Swiss-watch precision, but rather for the ability to quickly recognize a pattern or possibility, and to work past a complex set of obstacles. Soft skills are about **Reading, Recognizing, and Reacting.**

- The point of this tip is that hard skills and soft skills are different (literally, they use different structures of circuits in your brain), and thus are developed through different methods of deep practice.

- Begin by asking yourself which of these skills need to be absolutely 100-percent consistent every single time. Which need to be executed with machine-like precision? These are the hard skills.

- Then ask yourself, which skills need to be flexible, and variable, and depend on the situation? Which depend on instantly recognizing patterns and selecting one optimal choice? These are the soft skills.
