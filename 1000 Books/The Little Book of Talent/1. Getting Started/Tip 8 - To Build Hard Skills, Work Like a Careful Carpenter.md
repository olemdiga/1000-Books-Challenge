## Tip 8 - To Build Hard Skills, Work Like a Careful Carpenter

- To develop reliable hard skills, you need to connect the right wires in your brain. In this, it helps to be careful, slow, and keenly attuned to errors.
- Precision especially matters early on, because the first reps establish the pathways for the future.

- ***Our brains are good at building connections, they’re not so good at unbuilding them.***

- ***When you learn hard skills, be precise and measured. Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to errors, and fix them, particularly at the start. Learning fundamentals only seems boring - in fact, it’s the key moment of investment. If you build the right pathway now, you’ll save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the line.***
