# 2. Improving Skills 

> People in the hotbeds have a different relationship with practicing. Many of us view practice as necessary drudgery, the equivalent of being forced to eat your vegetables, far less important or interesting than the big game or the big performance. But in the talent hotbeds I visited, practice was the big game, the center of their world, ***the main focus of their daily lives.*** This approach succeeds because over time, practice is transformative, if itâ€™s the right kind of practice. ***Deep practice.***

> ***The key to deep practice is to reach. This means to stretch yourself slightly beyond your current ability, spending time in the zone of difficulty called the sweet spot. It means embracing the power of repetition, so the action becomes fast and automatic. It means creating a practice space that enables you to reach and repeat, stay engaged, and improve your skills over time.***

> The previous section was about getting ready. This section is about action - simple strategies and techniques to direct you toward deep practice and nudge you away from the unproductive swamp of shallow practice.
