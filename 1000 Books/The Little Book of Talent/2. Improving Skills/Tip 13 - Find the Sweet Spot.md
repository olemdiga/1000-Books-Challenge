## Tip 13 - Find the Sweet Spot

- ***There is a place, right on the edge of your ability, where you learn best and fastest. It’s called the sweet spot. Here’s how to find it.***
### Comfort Zone
- ***Sensations:*** Ease, effortlessness. You’re working, but not reaching or struggling. 
- ***Percentage of Successful Attempts:*** 80 percent and above. 

### Sweet Spot
- ***Sensations:*** Frustration, difficulty, alertness to errors. You’re fully engaged in an intense struggle - as if you’re stretching with all your might for a nearly unreachable goal, brushing it with your fingertips, then reaching again. 
- ***Percentage of Successful Attempts:*** 50–80 percent. 

### Survival Zone
- ***Sensations:*** Confusion, desperation. You’re overmatched - scrambling, thrashing, and guessing. You guess right sometimes, but it’s mostly luck. 
- ***Percentage of Successful Attempts:*** Below 50 percent. 

- ***Seek out ways to stretch yourself. Play on the edges of your competence.*** As Albert Einstein said, ***“One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one’s greatest efforts.”***
- The key word is “barely.” Ask yourself - If you tried your absolute hardest, what could you almost do? Mark the boundary of your current ability, and aim a little beyond it. That’s your spot.
