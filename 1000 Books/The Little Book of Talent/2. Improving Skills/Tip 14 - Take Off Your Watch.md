## Tip 14 - Take Off Your Watch

- Deep practice is not measured in minutes or hours, but in the number of high-quality reaches and repetitions you make - basically, how many new connections you form in your brain.
- Instead of counting minutes or hours, count reaches and reps.
-  Instead of saying, “I’m going to practice piano for twenty minutes,” tell yourself, “I’m going to do five intensive reps of that new song.” Instead of reading over that textbook for an hour, make flash cards and grade yourself on your efforts.

- ***Ignore the clock and get to the sweet spot, even if it’s only for a few minutes, and measure your progress by what counts - reaches and reps.***
