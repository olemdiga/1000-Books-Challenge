## Tip 15 - Break Every Move Down into Chunks

- Take it a little bit at a time. This advice works because it accurately reflects the way our brains learn. Every skill is built out of smaller pieces.

- Chunks are to skill what letters of the alphabet are to language. Alone, each is nearly useless, but when combined into bigger chunks (words), and when those chunks are combined into still bigger things (sentences, paragraphs), they can build something complex and beautiful.

- ***Practice one chunk by itself until youâ€™ve mastered it - then connect more chunks, one by one, exactly as you would combine letters to form a word. Then combine those chunks into still bigger chunks. And so on.***

- ***No matter what skill you set out to learn, the pattern is always the same - See the whole thing. Break it down to its simplest elements. Put it back together. Repeat.***
