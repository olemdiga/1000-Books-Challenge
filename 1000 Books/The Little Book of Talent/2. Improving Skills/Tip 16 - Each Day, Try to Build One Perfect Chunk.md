## Tip 16 - Each Day, Try to Build One Perfect Chunk 

- In our busy lives, it’s sometimes tempting to regard merely practicing as a success. We complete the appointed hour and sigh victoriously - mission accomplished! ***But the real goal isn’t practice; it’s progress.*** As John Wooden put it, ***“Never mistake mere activity for accomplishment.”***

- One useful method is to set a daily SAP - smallest achievable perfection. In this technique, you pick a single chunk that you can perfect - not just improve, not just “work on,” but ***get 100 percent consistently correct.***
- The point is to take the time to aim at a small, defined target, and then put all your effort toward hitting it.

- After all, you aren’t built to be transformed in a single day. You are built to improve little by little, connection by connection, rep by rep. As Wooden also said, ***“Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens - and when it happens, it lasts.”***
