- ***With deep practice, small daily practice “snacks” are more effective than once-a-week practice binges.*** The reason has to do with the way our brains grow - ***incrementally***, a little each day, even as we sleep.

- Or, as the music education pioneer Shinichi Suzuki puts it, ***“Practice on the days that you eat.”***

- ***“The key was total focus and being ruthless about noticing and fixing every tiny mistake from the start.”***

- The other advantage of practicing daily is that it becomes a habit. ***The act of practicing making time to do it, doing it well - can be thought of as a skill in itself, perhaps the most important skill of all.***
