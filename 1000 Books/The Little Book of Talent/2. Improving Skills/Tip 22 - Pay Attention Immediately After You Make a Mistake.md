## Tip 22 - Pay Attention Immediately After You Make a Mistake

- Most of us are allergic to mistakes. When we make one, our every instinct urges us to look away, ignore it, and pretend it didn’t happen. This is not good, because as we’ve seen, mistakes are our guideposts for improvement.
- People who pay deeper attention to an error learn significantly more than those who ignore it.

- ***Develop the habit of attending to your errors right away. Don’t wince, don’t close your eyes; look straight at them and see what really happened, and ask yourself what you can do next to improve. Take mistakes seriously, but never personally.***
