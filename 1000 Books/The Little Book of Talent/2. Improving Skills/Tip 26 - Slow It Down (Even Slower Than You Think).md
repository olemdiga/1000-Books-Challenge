## Tip 26 - Slow It Down (Even Slower Than You Think) 

- When we learn how to do something new, our immediate urge is to do it again, faster.
-  This urge for speed makes perfect sense, but it can also create sloppiness, particularly when it comes to hard skills. ***We trade precision - and long-term performance - for a temporary thrill. So, slow it down.***

- Super-slow practice works like a magnifying glass - It lets us sense our errors more clearly, and thus fix them.

- ***“It’s not how fast you can do it. It’s how slowly you can do it correctly.”***
