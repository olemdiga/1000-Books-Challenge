## Tip 29 - When You Get It Right, Mark the Spot 

- One of the most fulfilling moments of a practice session is when you have your first perfect rep. When this happens, freeze. Rewind the mental tape and play the move again in your mind. Memorize the feeling, the rhythm, the physical and mental sensations.
- The point is to mark this moment - this is the spot where you want to go again and again. This is not the finish - it’s the new starting line for perfecting the skill until it becomes automatic.
- “Practice begins when you get it right.”
