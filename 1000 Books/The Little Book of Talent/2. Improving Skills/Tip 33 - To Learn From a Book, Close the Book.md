## Tip 33 - To Learn From a Book, Close the Book 

- Passively reading a book - a relatively effortless process, letting the words wash over you like a warm bath - doesnâ€™t put you in the sweet spot. ***Less reaching equals less learning.***
- On the other hand, closing the book and writing a summary forces you to figure out the key points (one set of reaches), process and organize those ideas so they make sense (more reaches), and write them on the page (still more reaches, along with repetition).
- The equation is always the same - ***More reaching equals more learning.***
