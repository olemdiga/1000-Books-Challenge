## Tip 37 - To Choose the Best Practice Method, Use the R.E.P.S. Gauge

- The biggest problem in choosing a practice strategy is not that there are too many. How do you identify the best methods? This tip provides a way to measure practice effectiveness. It’s called the R.E.P.S. gauge. Each letter stands for a key element of deep practice.

> **R - Reaching and Repeating
> E - Engagement
> P - Purposefulness
> S - Strong, Speedy Feedback.**

1. ***REACHING AND REPEATING.*** Does the practice have you operating on the edge of your ability, reaching and repeating?
2. ***ENGAGEMENT.*** Is the practice immersive? Does it command your attention? Does it use emotion to propel you toward a goal? 
3. ***PURPOSEFULNESS.*** Does the task directly connect to the skill you want to build?
4. ***STRONG, SPEEDY FEEDBACK.*** Does the learner receive a stream of accurate information about his performance - where he succeeded and where he made mistakes? 

- The idea of this gauge is simple - When given a choice between two practice methods, or when you’re inventing a new test or game, pick the one that maximizes these four qualities, the one with the most R.E.P.S. The larger lesson here is to pay attention to the design of your practice. Small changes in method can create large increases in learning velocity.
