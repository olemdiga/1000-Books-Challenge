## Tip 42 - Six Ways to Be a Better Teacher or Coach

- Sooner or later, no matter who you are, you’ll find yourself being a teacher, a coach, or a mentor. It might happen at home, at work, or on the playing field, but when it happens, it helps to have a few basic skills.

### 1) Use the First Few Seconds to Connect on an Emotional Level

- Take a moment and recall the best teacher or mentor you’ve ever known. If you’re like most people, your memories are less about what that person did than about the way that person made you feel. You knew, somehow, that they saw something special in you, and understood you. You trusted them.
- ***Effective teaching is built on trust***, and when it comes to trust, we humans are consistent - We decide if we’re going to trust someone in the first few seconds of the interaction. This is why good teachers use the first few seconds to connect on an emotional level, especially on the first encounter.

- There are lots of tools for making this connection - eye contact, body language, empathy, and humor being some of the most effective - but whatever you use, make sure you prioritize that connection above all else. ***Before you can teach, you have to show that you care.***

### 2) Avoid Giving Long Speeches - Instead, Deliver Vivid Chunks of Information

- Thanks to movies, many of us grow up thinking that great teachers and coaches stand nobly in front of groups and deliver inspiring speeches. Nothing could be further from the truth.
- ***Master teachers and coaches don’t stand in front; they stand alongside the individuals they’re helping. They don’t give long speeches; they deliver useful information in small, vivid chunks.***

- As a coach, I was accustomed to giving instruction to an entire team at the same time; for example, teaching them all the proper technique to field a grounder. But after spending time with master coaches, I started focusing on delivering short, targeted, customized messages to each player, one at a time. And it worked a lot better. Not only did players catch on more quickly, but the process also forged closer bonds of communication.

- When you’re coaching, picture the person’s brain lighting up, the wires sparking fitfully, reaching to make new connections. ***The question is not what big important message you can deliver. The question is, what vivid, concise message can you deliver right now that will guide her toward making the right reach?***

### 3) Be Allergic to Mushy Language

- One of the most common mistakes teachers and coaches make is using mushy, imprecise language.
- All good teaching follows the same blueprint - Try this concrete thing. Now try this concrete thing. Now try combining them into this concrete thing. Communicate with precise nouns  and numbers - things you can see and touch and measure - and avoid adjectives and adverbs, which don’t tell you precisely what to do. 

### 4) Make a Scorecard for Learning 

- Life is full of scorecards - sales figures, performance rankings, test scores, tournament results. The problem with those scorecards is that they can distort priorities, bending us toward short-term outcomes and away from the learning process. We’ve all seen it happen, in business and in sports. Organizations that focus maniacally on winning today tend to lose sight of the larger goal - learning and developing competencies for the long run. 
- The solution is to create your own scorecard. Pick a metric that measures the skill you want to develop, and start keeping track of it. Use that measure to motivate and orient your learners. As a saying goes, “You are what you count.” 

### 5) Maximize “Reachfulness”

- Reachfulness is the essence of learning. It happens when the learner is leaning forward, stretching, struggling, and improving. The point of this rule is that good teachers/​coaches/mentors find ways to design environments that tip people away from passivity and toward reachful action.

- The larger point is that being a good teacher means thinking like a designer. Ask yourself - What kind of space will create the most reachful environment? How can you replace moments of passivity with moments of active learning? 

### 6) Aim to Create Independent Learners

- Your long-term goal as a teacher, coach, or mentor is to help your learners improve so much that they no longer need you. To do this, avoid becoming the center of attention. Aim instead to create an environment where people can keep reaching on their own. Whenever possible, step away and create moments of independence. Think of your job as building a little master-coach chip in their brains - a tiny version of you, guiding them as they go forward.
