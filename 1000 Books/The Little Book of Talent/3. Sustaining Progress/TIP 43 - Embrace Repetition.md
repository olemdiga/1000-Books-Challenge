## TIP 43 - Embrace Repetition

- Repetition has a bad reputation. We tend to think of it as dull and uninspiring. But this perception is titanically wrong. Repetition is the single most powerful lever we have to improve our skills, because it uses the built-in mechanism for making the wires of our brains faster and more accurate.
-  As Bruce Lee said, ***“I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times.”***
