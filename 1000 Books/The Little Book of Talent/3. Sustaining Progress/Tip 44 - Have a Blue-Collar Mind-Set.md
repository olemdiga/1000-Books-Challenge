## Tip 44 - Have a Blue-Collar Mind-Set

- From a distance, top performers seem to live charmed, cushy lives. When you look closer, however, you’ll find that they spend vast portions of their life intensively practicing their craft.

- As the artist Chuck Close says, ***“Inspiration is for amateurs.”***
