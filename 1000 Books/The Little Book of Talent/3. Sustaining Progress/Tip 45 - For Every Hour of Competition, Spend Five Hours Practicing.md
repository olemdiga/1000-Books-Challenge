## Tip 45 - For Every Hour of Competition, Spend Five Hours Practicing

- Games are fun. Tournaments are exciting. Contests are thrilling. They also slow skill development, for four reasons:
	1. The presence of other people diminishes an appetite for risks, nudging you away from the sweet spot.
	2. Games reduce the number of quality reps.
	3. The pressure of games distorts priorities, encouraging shortcuts in technique.
	4. Games encourage players, coaches, and parents to judge success by the scoreboard rather than by how much was learned.

- Don’t get me wrong. Public competition is a great thing. It teaches invaluable lessons about teamwork, it helps build emotional control, and it’s fun. But it’s also, in many cases, a deeply inefficient way to improve skill. 
- One solution to the problem is to **make public performance a special occasion, not a routine.**
- A five-to-one ratio of practice time to performance time is a good starting point; ten to one is even better.
