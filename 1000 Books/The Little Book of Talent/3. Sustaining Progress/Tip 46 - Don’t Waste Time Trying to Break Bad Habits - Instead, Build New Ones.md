## Tip 46 - Don’t Waste Time Trying to Break Bad Habits - Instead, Build New Ones

- When it comes to dealing with bad habits, many of us try to attack the problem head-on, by trying to break the habit. This tactic, of course, doesn’t work, and we’re left with the old truth - habits are tough to break. The blame lies with our brains. While they are really good at building circuits, they are awful at unbuilding them. ***Try as you might to break it, the bad habit is still up there, wired into your brain, waiting patiently for a chance to be used.***

- The solution is to ignore the bad habit and put your energy toward building a new habit that will override the old one.

- To build new habits, start slowly. Expect to feel stupid and clumsy and frustrated at first after all, the new wires haven’t been built yet, and your brain still wants to follow the old pattern. Build the new habit by gradually increasing the difficulty, little by little. It takes time, but it’s the only way new habits grow.
