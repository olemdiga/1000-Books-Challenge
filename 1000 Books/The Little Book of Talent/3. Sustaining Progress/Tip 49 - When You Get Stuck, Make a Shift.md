## Tip 49 - When You Get Stuck, Make a Shift

- We all know the feeling. You start out in a new skill, you progress swiftly for a while, and then all of a sudden... you stop. Those are called plateaus.

- A plateau happens when your brain achieves a level of automaticity; in other words, when you can perform a skill on autopilot, without conscious thought. Our brains love autopilot, because in most situations it’s pretty handy. It lets us walk and ride bikes without having to think about it, freeing our brains for more important tasks. ***When it comes to developing talent, however, autopilot is the enemy, because it creates plateaus.***

- The best way past a plateau is to jostle yourself beyond it; to change your practice method so you disrupt your autopilot and rebuild a faster, better circuit. One way to do this is to speed things up - to force yourself to do the task faster than you normally would. Or you can slow things down - going so slowly that you highlight previously undetected mistakes. It doesn’t matter which technique you use, as long as you find a way to knock yourself out of autopilot and into your sweet spot.
