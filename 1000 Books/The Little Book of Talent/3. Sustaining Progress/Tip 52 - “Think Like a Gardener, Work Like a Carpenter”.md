## Tip 52 - “Think Like a Gardener, Work Like a Carpenter”

- We all want to improve our skills quickly - today, if not sooner. But the truth is, talent grows slowly. You would not criticize a seedling because it was not yet a tall oak tree; nor should you get upset because your skill circuitry is in the growth stage. Instead, build it with daily deep practice.
- Think patiently, without judgment. Work steadily, strategically, knowing that each piece connects to a larger whole.
